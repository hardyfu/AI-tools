### 1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

Let's take a moment and **reflect back upon** (回顾) our lives when we were 20 years old. Think about where you were and the **opportunities for work and career** (工作和职业机会) that **lay in front of you** (呈现在你面前). I'm curious. Tell me, how many of you had a **pretty good idea** (相当清楚的想法) of what you wanted to do for your career? Okay. Not too many. How many were **overwhelmed by** (/ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmd baɪ/, 不知所措；应接不暇) all the **options** (/ˈɑːpʃənz/, 选择)? Okay. I know I felt the same. Well, **buckle up** (系好安全带；做好准备). It's only going to get more overwhelming.

When I was 20 years old, I was graduating from Stanford University with a **degree in** (/dɪˈɡriː ɪn/, ...学位) pure mathematics. Nobody had sat me down to tell me that my pure math major wasn't going to be the most **desirable qualification** (/dɪˈzaɪərəbəl ˌkwɑːlɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/, 受欢迎的资历) for **prospective employers** (/prəˈspɛktɪv ɪmˈplɔɪərz/, 潜在雇主). And I probably wouldn't have listened if they did. So I went off along my **default path** (/dɪˈfɔːlt pæθ/, 默认路径), a math PhD program at UCLA, **buying at least one more year to figure out** (争取至少一年的时间来弄清楚) my career.

Now my first month in graduate school, Lehman Brothers, **went under** (/wɛnt ˈʌndər/, 破产；倒闭) the start of the **global financial crisis** (/ˈɡloʊbəl faɪˈnænʃəl ˈkraɪsɪs/, 全球金融危机). Most of my friends, particularly the ones that felt the most **secure in** (/sɪˈkjʊər ɪn/, 对...有安全感) their financial careers, **found themselves packing up their cubicles out of work** (发现自己收拾隔间失业了). Some of us wondered whether the economy would **recover at all** (完全复苏) or whether we were **in store for** (/ɪn stɔːr fɔːr/, 即将面临) another **decade-long** (/ˈdɛkeɪd lɔːŋ/, 长达十年的) great depression. But **amidst the uncertainty** (/əˈmɪdst ði ʌnˈsɜːrtnti/, 在不确定性中), the **pessimism** (/ˈpɛsɪmɪzəm/, 悲观主义), the **malaise** (/mæˈleɪz/, 普遍的不适；萎靡不振), really, of that time, some of us found a **source of optimism** (/sɔːrs əv ˈɑːptɪmɪzəm/, 乐观的源泉).

The iPhone, and in particular, the App Store, came out that very same year, 2008. I still remember when the SDK, which was the instruction manual for how to build iPhone apps, was released. I was at my parents' house, and I was up all night reading it, learning, trying to understand. I saw an **opportunity for** (机会) a **new level playing field** (新的公平竞争环境). And if you think about it, **pretty much everything** (几乎所有一切) I've done since then, the company that I created, my professional career, since that point, was a **product both of** (/ˈprɑːdʌkt boʊθ əv/, ...的产物) the economic malaise, but the technological optimism of the time as well.

But times have changed. If the questions I'm hearing on the **podcast circuit** (/ˈpɑːdkæst ˈsɜːrkɪt/, 播客圈) are **any indication** (/ˈɛni ˌɪndɪˈkeɪʃən/, 任何迹象), the **average** (/ˈævərɪdʒ/, 普通的；平均的) 20 year old today also has **quite a bit of fear** (相当多的恐惧). But this time, **emerging technology** (/ɪˈmɜːrdʒɪŋ tɛkˈnɑːlədʒi/, 新兴技术) is not the **antidote to** (/ˈæntɪˌdoʊt tuː/, ...的解药) that fear. It's a source. And they're asking themselves, will that career I'm looking at even **be around** (/biː əˈraʊnd/, 存在；还在) in 10 years? Will humans still be writing computer software? Will we even be writing books?

And I think one reason why it **feels different this time** (这次感觉不同) is because AI, unlike the iPhone, is the first tool that we've built that's **capable of** (/ˈkeɪpəbəl əv/, 有能力做...) leaving the toolbox and we don't yet know its **limits** (/ˈlɪmɪts/, 限制；局限). A few years ago, I **found out** (/faʊnd aʊt/, 创办) another company with the **mission to** (/ˈmɪʃən tuː/, 旨在...) build mathematical super intelligence. That's an **artificial intelligence** (/ˌɑːrtɪˈfɪʃəl ɪnˈtɛlɪdʒəns/, 人工智能) that can **reason** (/ˈriːzən/, 推理) and **solve problems** (解决问题) better than any mathematician. You know, when I grew up, I always thought of mathematics as the **pinnacle of** (/ˈpɪnəkəl əv/, ...的顶峰) human intellectual activity. It solved math problems. You could do pretty much anything. So a super human AI at mathematics could **potentially be** (/pəˈtɛnʃəli biː/, 可能成为) super human at everything. And that's a bit of a scary thought.

So when you think about that, and I **combine that with** (/kəmˈbaɪn ðæt wɪð/, 将...与...结合) my **day job** (/deɪ dʒɑːb/, 日常工作), which is running a **global financial services platform** (/ˈɡloʊbəl faɪˈnænʃəl ˈsɜːrvɪsɪz ˈplætfɔːrm/, 全球金融服务平台), it's **led to me spending a lot of time pondering** (/lɛd tuː miː ˈspɛndɪŋ ə lɑːt əv taɪm ˈpɑːndərɪŋ/, 让我花大量时间思考) one very important question. What do we do in a world where the **vast majority of** (/væst məˈdʒɔːrɪti əv/, 绝大多数的) today's jobs are gone? And I want to **analyze this question rationally** (/ˈænəlaɪz ðɪs ˈkwɛstʃən ˈræʃənəli/, 理性分析这个问题) without fear and **hyperbole** (/haɪˈpɜːrbəli/, 夸张). One way to do it is to **look back through history** (回顾历史) and see if there's been a time where we **face this type of job disruption** (/feɪs ðɪs taɪp əv dʒɑːb dɪsˈrʌpʃən/, 面临这种类型的职业颠覆) before at **anything near these levels** (达到接近这种程度). And how we as humans have **navigated it** (/ˈnævɪˌɡeɪtɪd ɪt/, 应对它). I should say one thing. I'm a **technologist** (/tɛkˈnɑːlədʒɪst/, 技术专家), not a historian. So with that **caveat** (/ˈkæviæt/, 警示；注意事项), let's go back in time to a world a 20-year-old would have known very long ago, tens of thousands of years ago to be more **precise** (/prɪˈsaɪs/, 精确的).

Now as you can tell, the **main occupations** (/meɪn ˌɑːkjuˈpeɪʃənz/, 主要职业) of this time, the Paleolithic era, are **largely gone** (/ˈlɑːrdʒli ɡɔːn/, 基本消失了), hunters, gatherers, tool makers, but they didn't **disappear overnight** (/ˌdɪsəˈpɪər ˌoʊvərˈnaɪt/, 一夜之间消失). Instead, they were **subdivided into** (/ˈsʌbdɪvaɪdɪd ˈɪntuː/, 细分为) lots of other more **specialized jobs** (/ˈspɛʃəlaɪzd dʒɑːbz/, 专业化工作). So why don't we move forward to the Neolithic era? Now here, humans have **mastered a few new things** (掌握了一些新事物), farming, keeping **livestock** (/ˈlaɪvstɑːk/, 牲畜), and I'm going to **zoom through this** (快速讲过), but this was a **big transformation** (/bɪɡ ˌtrænsfərˈmeɪʃən/, 巨大变革). Actually, the invention of these things allowed us to **spend more time doing what we consider creative work** (花更多时间做我们认为有创意的工作) and **less time on pure survival and subsistence** (更少时间用于纯粹的生存和维持生计). This **opened up a lot of new jobs** (开辟了许多新工作). You had **artisans** (/ˈɑːrtɪzənz/, 工匠) like weavers, you had farmers, of course, potters, construction laborers, and these jobs too, largely all gone. So in the U.S. today, we should say, farmers **make up less than** (/meɪk ʌp lɛs ðæn/, 占不到) 2% of the **workforce** (/ˈwɜːrkfɔːrs/, 劳动力).

Let's move ahead through the changing jobs of the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, one of my favorites, the Dark Ages. Here we've got the Renaissance in the Age of Exploration. **Too many jobs to count** (多到数不清的工作), a lot of them are gone. Now, any blacksmiths or explorers in this room? I didn't think so. I would have loved to be an explorer. **How cool of a job would that be** (那会是多么酷的工作)? It might **come back with** (/kʌm bæk wɪð/, 随着...回归) space exploration. My great grandfather was a farmer in a village near Stara's, Agorable, Gariah. Now **legend has it** (/ˈlɛdʒənd hæz ɪt/, 传说中), he was the first person in his village to see an automobile. And when he saw it, he ran back into the village and said, there's a dragon out in the fields. His son, my grandfather, was also a farmer that **didn't venture too far from** (/dɪdnt ˈvɛntʃər tuː fɑːr frɑːm/, 没有冒险走太远) the village. His son, my father, was the first in his family to **go to the big city** (去大城市), Varna Bulgaria, on the Black Sea coast, where I was also born. There he became a professor of tourism, which was certainly a job that my grandfather and great-grandfather **never imagined** (从未想象过).

If you think about it, most of our **last names** (/læst neɪmz/, 姓氏) are from jobs that our families no longer do. Potter, butler, butcher, even the most common, smith. Any **fletcherers** (/ˈflɛtʃərərz/, 弓箭匠) in the audience? Anyone know what a fletcher is? I was going over my talk this weekend and my son said, I know what a fletcher is, dad. He plays Minecraft. **Everything old is new again** (旧事重提；风水轮流转), right? A fletcher is someone that **makes and sells arrows** (制作并销售箭矢). So if you know someone with that last name, their relatives were **arms dealers** (/ɑːrmz ˈdiːlərz/, 军火商). Now my point in all of this is you can probably **take any prediction that you see in the media of job disruption** (接受媒体上任何关于职业颠覆的预测). And **in the fullness of time** (/ɪn ðə ˈfʊlnɪs əv taɪm/, 终有一天；到时候), at some point, even that will be an **underestimate** (/ˌʌndərˈɛstɪmɪt/, 低估). Even that will be **conservative** (/kənˈsɜːrvətɪv/, 保守的). And what we find is that **job disruption is then an essential quality of human evolution** (职业颠覆是人类进化的一个基本特征). We want work to disappear because it **means that we're doing our jobs as humans** (意味着我们正在履行作为人类的职责), making our lives better and easier. And when it comes to labor, we **yearn to increase** (/jɜːrn tuː ɪnˈkriːs/, 渴望增加) **dollars earned per hour worked** (/ˈdɑːlərz ɜːrnd pər ˈaʊər wɜːrkt/, 每小时的劳动所得). And this creates the **market for** (/ˈmɑːrkɪt fɔːr/, ...的市场) the **ever-improving set of innovations** (/ˈɛvər ɪmˈpruːvɪŋ sɛt əv ˌɪnəˈveɪʃənz/, 不断改进的创新集) that **save us time and money** (节省我们的时间和金钱).

So with AI, maybe it's not the job disruption itself that makes us so nervous, but the **speed with which it's happening** (它发生的速度) and the **acceleration** (/əkˌsɛləˈreɪʃən/, 加速). Maybe that's what makes us nervous. So why don't we accelerate? We're going to **go right through** (/ɡoʊ raɪt θruː/, 直接穿过) the **industrial revolution** (/ɪnˈdʌstriəl ˌrɛvəˈluːʃən/, 工业革命) into the **modern era** (/ˈmɑːdərn ˈɪrə/, 现代时代). So in the 20th century, a young person **in the wake of companies expanding and automating** (/ɪn ðə weɪk əv ˈkʌmpəniz ɪkˈspændɪŋ ænd ˈɔːtəmeɪtɪŋ/, 随着公司扩张和自动化), there was a lot of change, would have found an **entirely new menu of jobs** (全新的工作选择) that their parents **never had access to** (从未接触过). So instead of working in a factory, they would have had the **selection of a wide assortment of new office jobs** (/sɪˈlɛkʃən əv ə waɪd əˈsɔːrtmənt əv nuː ˈɔːfɪs dʒɑːbz/, 各种各样的新办公室工作选择). And some of the parents were probably thinking, you sit in a chair all day, that's not **real work** (真正的工作).

Now let's go through the internet era. Okay. Most of us have **lived through at least a portion of this** (至少经历了一部分). And we see **all around us jobs that didn't exist before** (我们周围有很多以前不存在的工作). Some of us are probably in them, maybe most of us. I know I am. So where does all this **leave our 20 year old at the dawn of the AI era** (/liːv aʊər ˈtwɛnti jɪər oʊld æt ðə dɔːn əv ði eɪ aɪ ˈɪrə/, 这将我们的20岁年轻人置于AI时代的黎明何处)? One feature that we found is **recurrent throughout generations** (/rɪˈkɜːrənt θruːˈaʊt ˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃənz/, 贯穿几代人反复出现). Is this feeling of **exceptionalism** (/ɪkˈsɛpʃənəlɪzəm/, 特殊主义). We'd like to think that somehow we're at a **discontinuity** (/ˌdɪskɑːntɪˈnuːɪti/, 不连续性), where history ends, and we're in a new world with **no precedent** (/noʊ ˈprɛsɪdənt/, 没有先例). And maybe it's true this time, we really don't know for **building a super assistant or an apex predator** (/ˈbɪldɪŋ ə ˈsuːpər əˈsɪstənt ɔːr ən ˈeɪpɛks ˈprɛdətər/, 建造超级助手还是顶级捕食者). We don't. And certainly all change and disruption **brings with it a painful transition** (/brɪŋz wɪð ɪt ə ˈpeɪnfəl trænˈzɪʃən/, 带来痛苦的转变). Jobs will disappear, perhaps they'll disappear at an **accelerating rate** (/əkˌsɛləˈreɪtɪŋ reɪt/, 加速的速度). But at the same time, what we've **gone through here** (在这里经历过) is tens of thousands of years of human history. And we see one **undeniable trend** (/ˌʌndɪˈnaɪəbəl trɛnd/, 不可否认的趋势). There's going to be new jobs and **lots and lots of them** (很多很多).

AI researchers talk about this idea of a **singularity** (/ˌsɪŋɡjuˈlærɪti/, 奇点), an **intelligence explosion** (/ɪnˈtɛlɪdʒəns ɪkˈsploʊʒən/, 智能爆炸). But what we see in the data is that we're also on a **curve of rapidly accelerating job creation** (/kɜːrv əv ˈræpɪdli əkˌsɛləˈreɪtɪŋ dʒɑːb kriˈeɪʃən/, 快速加速的就业创造曲线), which I like to call the job singularity, a **Cambrian explosion of** (/ˈkæmbriən ɪkˈsploʊʒən əv/, 寒武纪大爆发，指大规模涌现) not just new jobs, but new **job families** (/dʒɑːb ˈfæmɪliz/, 职业类别) across every **imaginable field** (/ɪˈmædʒɪnəbəl fiːld/, 可以想象的领域). So the internet **gave people worldwide reach** (赋予人们全球影响力). AI **gives them a world-class staff** (给他们世界一流的员工). And so if you look at this **cloud of jobs** (/klaʊd əv dʒɑːbz/, 大量的职位), certainly there's going to be some jobs that we **can't predict yet** (尚无法预测). But I think we can make some predictions. There's going to be a **flurry of new entrepreneurial activity** (/ˈflɜːri əv nuː ˌɑːntrəprəˈnɜːriəl ækˈtɪvɪti/, 大量新的创业活动) with **micro-corporations** (/ˈmaɪkroʊ ˌkɔːrpəˈreɪʃənz/, 微型企业), **solo institutions** (/ˈsoʊloʊ ˌɪnstɪˈtuːʃənz/, 独立机构), and **single-person unicorns** (/ˈsɪŋɡəl ˈpɜːrsən ˈjuːnɪkɔːrnz/, 单人独角兽公司), which **by the way** (/baɪ ðə weɪ/, 顺便说一下), I don't think we're **very far from** (/ˈvɛri fɑːr frɑːm/, 离...不远了).

Another **defining feature of** (/dɪˈfaɪnɪŋ ˈfiːtʃər əv/, ...的一个决定性特征) this job singularity is that when you look into the future, the jobs will not look like **real work** (真正的工作). Much like to our **predecessors** (/ˈprɛdɪˌsɛsərz/, 前辈), our current jobs would have looked like **leisure** (/ˈliːʒər/, 休闲). We have people getting **paid to play video games** (领薪水玩电子游戏), **eat at restaurants** (在餐馆吃饭), travel, and **talk to other friends on video** (通过视频与朋友聊天). Those last people we call **podcast bros** (/ˈpɑːdkæst broʊz/, 播客兄弟们). And we **take our jobs very seriously** (非常认真对待我们的工作). Those of us that **do well** (做得好) certainly wouldn't say it's easy. But if you took someone from the 20th century when people first started **contemplating these problems** (/ˈkɑːntɛmˌpleɪtɪŋ ðiz ˈprɑːbləmz/, 思考这些问题) and they could **peek into our world today** (/piːk ˈɪntuː aʊər wɜːrld təˈdeɪ/, 窥视我们今天的世界), they would think that all of the predictions around **technological unemployment** (/ˌtɛknəˈlɑːdʒɪkəl ˌʌnɪmˈplɔɪmənt/, 技术性失业) came true. They'd say we don't have any more jobs. And I bet that we would **feel the same about** (/fiːl ðə seɪm əˈbaʊt/, 对...有同样的感觉) our **descendants** (/dɪˈsɛndənts/, 后代) in the future.

So now what? We've shown that there's going to be **lots of jobs to choose from** (很多工作可供选择). Some would **argue too many** (/ˈɑːrɡjuː tuː ˈmɛni/, 争辩说太多了). And that the jobs along with the **flurry of new entrepreneurial activity** (大量新的创业活动) will likely **look like leisure to us** (对我们来说像休闲). Much like our jobs did to our **ancestors** (/ˈænsɛstərz/, 祖先). And I can tell you with **near certainty** (/nɪər ˈsɜːrtnti/, 几乎可以肯定) that a humanity that's **capable of building a super intelligent AI** (有能力建造超智能AI) also has the **creativity to navigate through** (/kriːeɪˈtɪvɪti tuː ˈnævɪˌɡeɪt θruː/, 创造力来应对) this **potential job, doom, and gloom scenario** (/pəˈtɛnʃəl dʒɑːb duːm ænd ɡluːm sɪˈnɛrioʊ/, 潜在的职业厄运情景). Although we'll **never stop worrying about it** (永远不会停止担忧). We'll never stop worrying about it. Because **being hyper vigilant about** (/biːɪŋ ˈhaɪpər ˈvɪdʒɪlənt əˈbaʊt/, 对...高度警惕) **threats to our survival** (/θrɛts tuː aʊər sərˈvaɪvəl/, 对我们生存的威胁) is a **key part of our survival mechanism** (/kiː pɑːrt əv aʊər sərˈvaɪvəl ˈmɛkəˌnɪzəm/, 我们生存机制的关键部分), also a **key part of evolution** (/kiː pɑːrt əv ˌɛvəˈluːʃən/, 进化的关键部分), what makes us human.

And although it'll **take a lot of time to go into** (/teɪk ə lɑːt əv taɪm tuː ˈɡoʊ ˈɪntuː/, 需要很多时间来深入探讨) what kind of jobs our **future proved** (/ˈfjuːtʃər pruːvd/, 经受住未来考验的), I can tell you that you shouldn't **take predictions about future job disruption to keep you from doing something you feel very passionately about** (让未来职业颠覆的预测阻止你做你非常热爱的事情). You know when I was a kid in the 90s, teachers **discouraged me from becoming** (/dɪˈskɜːrɪdʒd miː frɑːm bɪˈkʌmɪŋ/, 不鼓励我成为...) a **computer programmer** (/kəmˈpjuːtər ˈproʊˌɡræmər/, 电脑程序员). I don't know if many else heard this. But **back then it was a common thought that** (/bæk ðɛn ɪt wɑz ə ˈkɑːmən θɔːt ðæt/, 当时普遍认为) all those jobs would be **shipped off to China** (/ʃɪpt ɔːf tuː ˈtʃaɪnə/, 转移到中国). Around the same time, if you guys remember, 1997, Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess. That was the first time an AI **succeeded in what was considered a solely human intellectual fair** (/səkˈsiːdɪd ɪn wɑt wɑz kənˈsɪdərd ə ˈsoʊli ˈhjuːmən ˌɪntəˈlɛktʃuəl fɛr/, 成功地完成了被认为是纯粹人类智力竞赛的事情). But now the chess industry is **booming bigger than ever** (/ˈbuːmɪŋ ˈbɪɡər ðæn ˈɛvər/, 比以往任何时候都更加蓬勃发展). So even where it **seems obvious** (/siːmz ˈɑːbviəs/, 显而易见), sometimes our predictions of the future **end up being completely off** (/ɛnd ʌp ˈbiːɪŋ kəmˈpliːtli ɔːf/, 结果完全错了).

Humanity has always **excelled at providing itself with meaning and purpose** (/ɪkˈsɛld æt prəˈvaɪdɪŋ ɪtˈsɛlf wɪð ˈmiːnɪŋ ænd ˈpɜːrpəs/, 擅长赋予自身意义和目标), even in the **darkest and most uncertain of times** (/ˈdɑːrkɪst ænd moʊst ʌnˈsɜːrtn əv taɪmz/, 最黑暗和最不确定的时期). So if I had to guess, I **feel very, very confident that** (/fiːl ˈvɛri ˈvɛri ˈkɑːnfɪdənt ðæt/, 非常非常有信心) the 20-year-olds of the future, perhaps **in collaboration with** (/ɪn kəˌlæbəˈreɪʃən wɪð/, 与...合作), AI, will continue to **build new things** (建造新事物), which **simultaneously we're going to be scared of, but also excited by** (/ˌsaɪməlˈteɪniəsli wiːr ˈɡoʊɪŋ tuː biː skɛrd əv bʌt ˈɔːlsoʊ ɪkˈsaɪtɪd baɪ/, 同时我们会感到害怕，但也会感到兴奋). Thank you for **considering these ideas** (/kənˈsɪdərɪŋ ðiz aɪˈdiːəz/, 考虑这些想法).
