### 1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

Hey everyone, hi, I'm an **independent** (/ˌɪndɪˈpendənt/, 独立的) **filmmaker** (/ˈfɪlmˌmeɪkər/, 电影制作人) and for the past 20 years I've been making **documentaries** (/ˌdɒkjʊˈmentəriz/, 纪录片) about design, art and music, but they're really about people. In **over the years** (多年来) I **started to question** (开始质疑) the **limitations** (/ˌlɪmɪˈteɪʃənz/, 局限性) of documentary filmmaking because human beings are **multi-dimensional** (/ˌmʌlti-dɪˈmenʃənl/, 多维的). There's never just one story about any of us, but documentary film is **by its nature** (根据其本质) **reductive** (/rɪˈdʌktɪv/, 还原性的，简化性的). Any documentary you've ever seen is just a **tiny sliver of** (一小部分) the actual story. But **what if** (如果...会怎样？) a film could tell more than one story? Or **what if** (如果...会怎样？) one film could tell thousands of stories about its **subject** (/ˈsʌbdʒɪkt/, 主题，对象)? How can we **re-envision** (/ˌriːɪnˈvɪʒən/, 重新构想) documentaries so that they were as **multi-faceted** (/ˌmʌltiˈfæsɪtɪd/, 多方面的) as human beings are? Well that's what my team and I have been **working on** (致力于) and last year we **released a film** (发行了一部电影) called ENO.

It's a documentary about the musician and artist Brian ENO that changes **every time it's shown** (每次播放时). It's the world's first **generative** (/ˈdʒenərətɪv/, 生成的，生成的) **feature film** (/ˈfiːtʃər fɪlm/, 故事片) and there are billions of possible **variations** (/ˌveriˈeɪʃənz/, 变体，变化) of it. It's always a story about Brian ENO. It's just a different story every time you watch it. So you probably **have some questions** (有一些问题) like how does the film change? Why does the film change? How do I **talk to my friend about** (和朋友谈论) a movie if they've seen a **totally different version** (完全不同的版本) of it? Or **why are you doing this to us** (你为什么要这样对我们) Gary? We **like our movies the way they are** (喜欢电影现有的样子). Yes we all love movies. We've watched hundreds of them in our lifetime, thousands probably. And we **have our favorites** (有我们偏爱的). But there's one thing that all of these movies **have in common** (有共同之处). They are all **linear** (/ˈlɪniər/, 线性的) **fixed experiences** (固定不变的体验). There's a beginning and an end and they're the same **every time we watch them** (每次观看时). But have you ever wondered why? Like **why do films have to be** (为什么电影必须是) the same every time?

The **reason** (/ˈriːzn/, 原因) is actually a **technical constraint** (/ˈteknɪkl kənˈstreɪnt/, 技术限制) from 130 years ago when cinema **was born** (诞生) and film was a **physical medium** (/ˈfɪzɪkl ˈmiːdiəm/, 物理媒介). A **reel** (/riːl/, 卷轴) of **celluloid** (/ˈseljʊlɔɪd/, 赛璐珞) images that had to **scroll through** (滚动通过) cameras and projectors and they had to make **duplicate copies of** (复制) those reels and **send them out to** (分发到) theaters. But 25 or 30 years ago when filmmaking all **went digital** (数字化), suddenly this **constraint of physicality is gone** (物理限制消失了). But we continue to make movies in the same way we always have. It's like we're **playing by a rulebook** (墨守成规) that doesn't exist anymore.

So in 2019 I **reached out to** (联系) Brendan Dawes who is a digital artist in England and we **started experimenting** (开始实验). We **wanted to see if we could make** (我们想看看是否能制作) a **cinematic documentary** (/ˌsɪnəˈmætɪk ˌdɒkjʊˈmentəri/, 电影纪录片) that was created **dynamically** (/daɪˈnæmɪkli/, 动态地) in software with real **footage** (/ˈfʊtɪdʒ/, 影像资料) that could **tell a different story each time** (每次讲述不同的故事). We **built a generative video platform** (构建了一个生成式视频平台) that was **entirely human coded** (完全由人工编码的). It wasn't **AI model based** (基于人工智能模型) or **trained on other people's work** (基于他人作品训练的). And **as we were experimenting** (当我们实验时) we **realized like who the ideal subject would be** (意识到谁会是理想的主题) for the first generative film and then we **reached out to** (联系) this guy. Can you tell us your full name? Brian, Peter, George, Sanchon, LeBaptiste, Tila Sal, Eno. Well, we'll just use his shortened form his name for this talk.

So Brian for the past 50 years has been **pushing the boundaries of** (拓展...的界限) creativity and technology **from his... to his...** (从他的...到他的...) electronic music experiments and Roxy music to his **collaborations** (/kəˌlæbəˈreɪʃənz/, 合作) with David Bowie on records like Heroes to producing, talking heads, U2, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, so many others. And he's released over 40 **solo** (/ˈsoʊloʊ/, 独奏的，独立的) and collaboration records. And in the 1990s long before **generative AI** (/ˈdʒenərətɪv ˌeɪˈaɪ/, 生成式人工智能), Brian was making software to create generative music. He **likened it to** (将其比作) **planting the seeds for** (播下...的种子) a piece of music and then **letting that piece of music flower** (让那段音乐开花) in thousands of different ways **over the course of time** (随着时间的推移). It was like the music was **a living thing** (一个有生命的东西).

Now I'd actually **approached Brian** (接触了Brian) several years before this about **doing a normal documentary** (制作一部普通纪录片) and he **turned me down** (拒绝了我) and he **turned down a lot of filmmakers** (拒绝了很多电影制作人). But **his reason was really fascinating** (他的理由非常引人入胜). He said he **hated biographical documentaries** (/ˌbaɪəˈɡræfɪkl ˌdɒkjʊˈmentəriz/, 传记纪录片) because it was always **one person's version of** (某人对...的看法/版本) another person's story and there was **never just one story about anyone** (从没有关于任何人的单一故事). But Brendan and I thought we **had a solution to this** (有解决办法) and we **showed him a early demo of** (给他展示了一个早期演示) our generative film software and he was **really excited** (非常兴奋). I still don't think he **wanted to have a movie made about him** (想让他拍一部关于他的电影), but he **wanted to be part of** (想参与) this generative film **experiment** (/ɪkˈsperɪmənt/, 实验) and **that was the price that he had pay** (那就是他必须付出的代价).

Brian **gave us access to** (给了我们访问权) hundreds of hours of **archival footage** (/ˈɑːrkaɪvl ˈfʊtɪdʒ/, 档案影像资料) on every **obsolete** (/ˌɒbsəˈliːt/, 过时的) **video tape format imaginable** (可以想象的录像带格式). It **took us two years just to digitize and catalog all this stuff** (我们花了两年时间才将所有这些资料数字化并编目). But we **needed more than just** (不仅仅需要) archival footage to tell this story. So I filmed another 50 hours with Brian talking about his **creative process** (/kriˈeɪtɪv ˈprəʊses/, 创作过程). In the end we had **over 500 hours of material** (超过500小时的素材) for this generative software platform and I'll show you **how that works** (它是如何运作的).

We **started off with** (以...开始) a **data set of** (数据集) **edited scenes** (/ˈedɪtɪd siːnz/, 已剪辑的场景), **raw footage** (/rɔː ˈfʊtɪdʒ/, 未经处理的影像) and music and the system **selects pieces from** (从中选择片段) that material and **builds them into** (将它们构建成) a film that's probably 85 to 90 minutes long. Now the system **knows what all the contents of** (知道所有内容) these pieces are and it **knows how to arrange them into** (知道如何将它们整理成) a **good story flow** (良好故事流程). It also **creates transitions** (/kænˈsɪdərɪŋ/, 过渡) between the scenes **dynamically in real time** (实时动态地). The **biggest challenge for us was** (我们面临的最大挑战是) **how to make it so that** (如何做到) every version of the film had an **engaging story arc** (/ɪnˈɡeɪdʒɪŋ ˈstɔːri ɑːrk/, 引人入胜的故事情节) **regardless of what** (无论什么) individual pieces were in it.

Filmmakers are **notoriously controlled for it** (以控制欲强而闻名), but I **still have control** (仍然有控制权), but it's **on this higher level** (在更高层面). I'm **curating** (/ˈkjʊəreɪtɪŋ/, 策划，管理) all the different little pieces that could **go into** (进入) this system and I'm also **designing the limitless ways** (设计无限的方式) that they can **interact** (/ˌɪntərˈækt/, 互动). So I don't **have control over the contents of** (控制内容) each **individual** (/ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəl/, 单个的) film, but **it doesn't matter** (没关系) because **it always works** (它总是有效). We **designed it that way** (我们就是这样设计的) and I **get to be surprised by** (能够被...惊艳到) my own film every time I watch it, which is **crazy** (/ˈkreɪzi/, 疯狂的) and so **liberating** (/ˈlɪbəreɪtɪŋ/, 解放的，令人自由的). If you have 500 hours of footage and you've **got to get down to** (必须压缩到) 90 minute film, this is what you're left with. It's the **cutting room floor thing** (剪辑废弃物). Normally in a film you'd **have to get rid of** (不得不摆脱) all that other footage and get it down to that time thing. **Killing your darlings** (忍痛割爱) is what they say. But **in this approach** (在这种方法中) there is **no cutting room floor** (没有剪辑废弃物). I can **put as much material in** (放入尽可能多的素材) and it will **come up in different versions of the film** (以不同版本出现在电影中) in different ways. So it's not like a **choose your own adventure** (选择你自己的冒险), well actually it's **more like the adventure choosing you** (更像是冒险选择了你).

But another thing that we **built in that's really cool** (内置的非常酷的功能) is that we had **in any iteration of the film** (在电影的任何迭代版本中) and everyone either Laurie Anderson or David Byrne will **appear and choose** (出现并选择) one of Brian's that they're called Obliq Strategies Cards. These are like **random prompts** (/ˈrændəm prɒmpts/, 随机提示). If you're **in a creative bind** (在创作困境中) you can read them. So there's dozens of them. And **depending on which one comes up** (取决于哪一个出现) in the film it will **divert the movie** (/daɪˈvɜːrt ðə ˈmuːvi/, 改变电影走向) or **react in some way** (以某种方式回应). So I'll show you how with **how that works** (它是如何运作的). Retrace your steps. Turn it upside down. Gardening is not architectures. So this is Katinas. That's a **family of plants** (/ˈfæmɪli əv plænts/, 植物科) that I **like a lot** (非常喜欢). In fact, in this garden we have a lot of Katinas, a lot of dogwood. There are **many more cards** (更多卡片) and **many more directions** (更多方向) that they can **push the film** (推动电影). The code that we've been seeing on screen is our system **parsing the data set** (/ˈpɑːrsɪŋ ðə ˈdeɪtə set/, 解析数据集) and **going through all the file names** (遍历所有文件名) and **deciding what it's going to choose next** (决定接下来选择什么).

We **premiered the film at** (/prɪˈmɪərd ðə fɪlm æt/, 电影在...首映) the Sundance Film Festival and we've **shown it hundreds of cinemas around the world since then** (从那时起已经在全球数百家电影院放映). And **every time it's been a different version** (每次都是不同版本) and **each audience that's seen it was seeing a film that was made for them** (每位观众看到的都是为他们制作的电影) that **no other audience in the world will see** (世界上没有其他观众会看到). People have **come back three, four, ten, twenty times or more** (回来了三、四、十、二十次或更多) to **see different versions** (看不同版本) and every time they're **getting another layer of** (获得另一层深意) Brian's story. Then they **talked to their friends** (和朋友交谈) and they're like **comparing versions** (比较版本). Did you see the David Bowie who was seen? Now I didn't see it. So it's a **totally new way to watch movies** (全新的观影方式). Oh, the film is **shortlisted the Academy Award for** (/ˈʃɔːrtlɪstɪd ði əˈkædəmi əˈwɔːrd fɔːr/, 入围奥斯卡金像奖). I **buried the lead** (把重点放到后面说). I **buried the lead** (把重点放到后面说). I **buried the lead** (把重点放到后面说).

But the question was **what was actually being nominated** (实际提名的是什么)? Like **which version of** (哪个版本) the billions of **different versions of the film** (电影的不同版本)? And all of them, like **nobody really knew** (没有人真正知道). But these are **questions that the film industry in Hollywood will have to answer soon** (好莱坞电影业很快就不得不回答的问题). Now we're **developing streaming software** (/dɪˈveləpɪŋ ˈstriːmɪŋ ˈsɒftwer/, 开发流媒体软件) so we can **stream generative films like this** (流播此类生成式电影). And we're also **collaborating with other filmmakers** (与其他电影制作人合作) to **bring this technology into their films** (将这项技术引入他们的电影). And there's **so many creative possibilities** (如此多的创意可能性) **as we scale this idea up** (随着我们扩大这个想法). Like **what about a Marvel film** (漫威电影怎么样) where it's **different in every theater** (每个影院都不同) and **fans can go see multiple versions** (影迷可以观看多个版本) and **piece together the story puzzle** (拼凑故事线索). We can also **remix existing films with a software** (/ˈriːmɪks ɪɡˈzɪstɪŋ fɪlmz wɪð ə ˈsɒftwer/, 用软件重混现有电影). For the past few months we've been playing with a generative version of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive which is crazy. It just **re-edits itself over and over again** (一遍又一遍地重新剪辑) or it could just **play forever and never repeat** (永远播放且不重复).

**Just to be clear** (只是为了澄清), this **approach** (/əˈproʊtʃ/, 方法，途径), I'm **not saying it's a replacement for** (不是说它是...的替代品) normal movies but **it's a different path** (这是一条不同的道路). And I think it's **so important for us to keep questioning these legacy models** (对我们来说，持续质疑这些传统模式非常重要) **just because something is one way for a long time doesn't mean it's the only way or the best way** (仅仅因为一件事长期以来都是某种方式，并不意味着它是唯一或最好的方式). As filmmakers we've **never had to ask the question of** (从未需要问的问题) like **how would my film change if it could change** (如果我的电影能改变，它会如何改变) because we **didn't have the technical capability to even do it** (甚至没有技术能力去实现). So **now that we have that** (既然我们有了这个) **the fun part is thinking about** (有趣的部分在于思考) all the **new storytelling possibilities** (新的讲故事的可能性) and all the **cinematic languages** (/ˌsɪnəˈmætɪk ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒɪz/, 电影语言) that this can **unlock** (/ʌnˈlɒk/, 解锁，开启). When you **create something** (创造一些东西) you're doing this thing that humans are **very good at** (非常擅长) which is imaginary. We **really need to be able to harness the intelligence and creativity of** (真正需要能够利用...的智慧和创造力) **everybody actually** (实际上是每个人). Art is **a way we do that** (我们做到这一点的一种方式). I think that's a **real hope of the future** (未来的真正希望). You said finished? We'll **never be finished reinventing the way we tell stories** (永远不会停止重塑我们讲故事的方式) **as human beings** (作为人类) but this talk is finished. **Thank you so much everyone** (非常感谢大家).
