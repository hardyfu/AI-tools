## 1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

Let's **take a moment and reflect back upon** (/rɪˈflɛkt bæk əˈpɑn/, 回顾，反思) our lives when we were 20 years old. Think about where you were and the **opportunities for work and career that lay in front of you** (/ˌlɛɪ ɪn ˈfrʌnt əv ju/, 摆在你面前的工作和职业机会). I'm curious. Tell me, how many of you had a **pretty good idea** (/ˌprɪti ɡʊd aɪˈdiə/, 相当清楚的想法) of what you wanted to do for your career? Okay. Not too many. How many were **overwhelmed** (/ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmd/, 不知所措的，应接不暇的) by all the options? Okay. I know I felt the same. Well, **buckle up** (/ˈbʌkl ʌp/, 系好安全带；做好准备应对困难或变化). It's only going to get more overwhelming. When I was 20 years old, I was graduating from Stanford University with a degree in pure mathematics. Nobody had sat me down to tell me that my pure math major wasn't going to be the most **desirable qualification** (/dɪˈzaɪrəbəl ˌkwɑləfɪˈkeɪʃən/, 受欢迎的资历) for **prospective employers** (/prəˈspɛktɪv ɪmˈplɔɪərz/, 潜在雇主). And I probably wouldn't have listened if they did. So I **went off along my default path** (/ˌwɛnt ɔf əˈlɔŋ maɪ dɪˈfɔlt pæθ/, 沿着我默认的道路走下去), a math PhD program at UCLA, **buying at least one more year to figure out** (/ˈbaɪɪŋ æt liːst wʌn mɔr jɪr tə ˈfɪɡjər aʊt/, 争取至少一年的时间来弄清楚) my career.

Now my first month in graduate school, Lehman Brothers, **went under** (/ˌwɛnt ˈʌndər/, 破产，倒闭) the start of the global financial crisis. Most of my friends, particularly the ones that **felt the most secure in their financial careers** (/ˌfɛlt ðə moʊst sɪˈkjʊər ɪn ðɛr faɪˈnænʃəl kəˈrɪrz/, 对他们的金融职业生涯感到最安心的), found themselves **packing up their cubicles** (/ˌpækɪŋ ʌp ðɛr ˈkjuːbɪkəlz/, 打包他们的办公隔间) out of work. Some of us wondered whether the economy would **recover at all** (/rɪˈkʌvər æt ɔl/, 根本无法恢复) or whether we were **in store for** (/ɪn stɔr fɔr/, 即将面临) another decade-long great depression. But **amidst the uncertainty, the pessimism, the malaise** (/əˈmɪdst ði ʌnˈsɜrtnti, ðə ˈpɛsɪmɪzəm, ðə məˈleɪz/, 在不确定性、悲观情绪和普遍的不适感之中), really, of that time, some of us found a **source of optimism** (/sɔrs əv ˈɑptɪmɪzəm/, 乐观的源泉). The iPhone, and in particular, the App Store, came out that very same year, 2008. I still remember when the SDK, which was the instruction manual for how to build iPhone apps, was released. I was at my parents' house, and I was **up all night reading it** (/ʌp ɔl naɪt ˈriːdɪŋ ɪt/, 通宵阅读). I saw an **opportunity for a new level playing field** (/ˌɑpərˈtuːnɪti fɔr ə nu ˈlɛvəl ˈpleɪɪŋ fiːld/, 获得一个公平竞争的新机会). And if you think about it, pretty much everything I've done since then, the company that I created, my professional career, since that point, was a product both of the economic **malaise** (/məˈleɪz/, 普遍的不适；萎靡不振), but the technological optimism of the time as well.

But times have changed. If the questions I'm hearing on the podcast circuit are **any indication** (/ˌɛni ˌɪndɪˈkeɪʃən/, 任何迹象), the average 20 year old today also has quite a bit of fear. But this time, **emerging technology** (/ɪˈmɜrdʒɪŋ tɛkˈnɑlədʒi/, 新兴技术) is not the **antidote to that fear** (/ˈæntɪˌdoʊt tə ðæt fɪr/, 消除那种恐惧的解药). It's a source. And they're asking themselves, will that career I'm looking at even **be around in 10 years** (/bi əˈraʊnd ɪn tɛn jɪrz/, 10年后还会存在)? Will humans still be writing computer software? Will we even be writing books? And I think one reason why it **feels different this time** (/fiːlz ˈdɪfərənt ðɪs taɪm/, 这次感觉不同) is because AI, unlike the iPhone, is the first tool that we've built that's **capable of leaving the toolbox** (/ˈkeɪpəbəl əv ˈliːvɪŋ ðə ˈtuːlbɑks/, 能够脱离工具箱独立运行) and we don't yet know its limits. A few years ago, I co-founded another company with the mission to build mathematical super intelligence. That's an artificial intelligence that can **reason and solve problems** (/ˈriːzən æn sɑlv ˈprɑbləmz/, 推理和解决问题) better than any mathematician. You know, when I grew up, I always thought of mathematics as the **pinnacle of human intellectual activity** (/ˈpɪnəkəl əv ˈhjuːmən ˌɪntəˈlɛktʃuəl ækˈtɪvɪti/, 人类智力活动的巅峰). It solved math problems. You could do pretty much anything. So a super human AI at mathematics could **potentially be super human at everything** (/pəˈtɛnʃəli bi ˌsuːpər ˈhjuːmən æt ˈɛvriˌθɪŋ/, 潜在地在所有方面都超越人类). And that's a bit of a scary thought. So when you think about that, and I **combine that with my day job** (/kəmˈbaɪn ðæt wɪð maɪ deɪ dʒɑb/, 将其与我的日常工作结合起来), which is running a global financial services platform, it's led to me spending a lot of time **pondering one very important question** (/ˈpɑndərɪŋ wʌn ˈvɛri ɪmˈpɔrtənt ˈkwɛstʃən/, 思考一个非常重要的问题). What do we do in a world where the **vast majority** (/væst məˈdʒɔrɪti/, 绝大多数) of today's jobs are gone? And I want to **analyze this question rationally without fear and hyperbole** (/ˈænəlaɪz ðɪs ˈkwɛstʃən ˈræʃnəli wɪðˈaʊt fɪr æn haɪˈpɜrbəli/, 理性地分析这个问题，不带恐惧和夸大其词). One way to do it is to look back through history and see if there's been a time where we **face this type of job disruption** (/feɪs ðɪs taɪp əv dʒɑb dɪsˈrʌpʃən/, 面临这种类型的就业颠覆) before at anything near these levels and how we as humans have **navigated it** (/ˈnævɪˌɡeɪtɪd ɪt/, 应对、驾驭它). I should say one thing. I'm a technologist, not a historian. So **with that caveat** (/wɪð ðæt ˈkæviˌæt/, 有了这项说明/警告), let's go back in time to a world a 20-year-old would have known very long ago, tens of thousands of years ago to be more precise.

Now as you can tell, the **main occupations** (/meɪn ˌɑkjuˈpeɪʃənz/, 主要职业) of this time, the Paleolithic era, are **largely gone** (/ˈlɑrdʒli ɡɔn/, 大部分消失了), hunters, gatherers, tool makers, but they didn't **disappear overnight** (/ˌdɪsəˈpɪər ˌoʊvərˈnaɪt/, 一夜之间消失). Instead, they were **subdivided into** (/ˌsʌbdɪˈvaɪdɪd ˈɪntu/, 被细分为) lots of other more specialized jobs. So why don't we move forward to the Neolithic era? Now here, humans have **mastered a few new things** (/ˈmæstərd ə fju nu θɪŋz/, 掌握了一些新技能), farming, keeping livestock, and I'm going to zoom through this, but this was a **big transformation** (/bɪɡ ˌtrænsfərˈmeɪʃən/, 巨大的转变). Actually, the invention of these things allowed us to spend more time doing what we consider creative work and less time on **pure survival and subsistence** (/pjʊr sərˈvaɪvəl æn səbˈsɪstəns/, 纯粹的生存和糊口). This **opened up a lot of new jobs** (/ˌoʊpənd ʌp ə lɑt əv nu dʒɑbz/, 创造了许多新工作). You had artisans like weavers, you had farmers, of course, potters, construction laborers, and these jobs too, **largely all gone** (/ˈlɑrdʒli ɔl ɡɔn/, 大部分都消失了). So in the U.S. today, we should say, farmers **make up less than 2% of the workforce** (/meɪk ʌp lɛs ðæn tu pərˈsɛnt əv ðə ˈwɜrkˌfɔrs/, 占劳动力不到2%). Let's move ahead through the changing jobs of the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, one of my favorites, the Dark Ages. Here we've got the Renaissance in the Age of Exploration. Too many jobs to count, a lot of them are gone. Now, any blacksmiths or explorers in this room? I didn't think so. I would have loved to be an explorer. How cool of a job would that be? It might come back with space exploration. My great grandfather was a farmer in a village near Stara's, Agorable, Gariah. Now legend has it, he was the first person in his village to see an automobile. And when he saw it, he ran back into the village and said, there's a dragon out in the fields. His son, my grandfather, was also a farmer that **didn't venture too far from the village** (/dɪdnt ˈvɛntʃər tu fɑr frəm ðə ˈvɪlɪdʒ/, 没有远离村庄). His son, my father, was the first in his family to go to the big city, Varna Bulgaria, on the Black Sea coast, where I was also born. There he became a professor of tourism, which was certainly a job that my grandfather and great-grandfather never imagined. If you think about it, most of our last names are from jobs that our families no longer do. Potter, butler, butcher, even the most common, smith. Any fletcherers in the audience? Anyone know what a fletcher is? I was going over my talk this weekend and my son said, I know what a fletcher is, dad. He plays Minecraft. Everything old is new again, right? A fletcher is someone that makes and sells arrows. So if you know someone with that last name, their relatives were **arms dealers** (/ɑrmz ˈdiːlərz/, 军火商).

Now my point in all of this is you can probably **take any prediction that you see in the media of job disruption** (/teɪk ˈɛni prɪˈdɪkʃən ðæt ju si ɪn ðə ˈmiːdiə əv dʒɑb dɪsˈrʌpʃən/, 对媒体上任何关于就业颠覆的预测). And **in the fullness of time** (/ɪn ðə ˈfʊlnɪs əv taɪm/, 假以时日，最终), at some point, even that will be an underestimate. Even that will be conservative. And what we find is that **job disruption is then an essential quality of human evolution** (/dʒɑb dɪsˈrʌpʃən ɪz ðɛn ən ɪˈsɛnʃəl ˈkwɑləti əv ˈhjuːmən ˌɛvəˈluːʃən/, 职业颠覆是人类进化的一个基本特征). We want work to disappear because it means that we're doing our jobs as humans, making our lives better and easier. And when it comes to labor, we **yearn to increase dollars earned per hour worked** (/jɜrn tə ɪnˈkriːs ˈdɑlərz ɜrnd pər ˈaʊər wɜrkt/, 渴望提高每小时收入). And this creates the market for the **ever-improving set of innovations** (/ˌɛvər ɪmˈpruːvɪŋ sɛt əv ˌɪnəˈveɪʃənz/, 不断改进的创新系列) that save us time and money. So with AI, maybe it's not the job disruption itself that makes us so nervous, but the **speed with which it's happening and the acceleration** (/spiːd wɪð wɪtʃ ɪts ˈhæpənɪŋ æn ði ækˌsɛləˈreɪʃən/, 发生的速度和加速). Maybe that's what makes us nervous. So why don't we accelerate? We're going to go right through the industrial revolution into the modern era. So in the 20th century, a young person in the **wake of companies expanding and automating** (/weɪk əv ˈkʌmpəniz ɪkˈspændɪŋ æn ˈɔtəˌmeɪtɪŋ/, 随着公司扩张和自动化), there was a lot of change, would have found an **entirely new menu of jobs** (/ɛnˈtaɪərli nu ˈmɛnju əv dʒɑbz/, 全新的工作选择). And some of the parents were probably thinking, you sit in a chair all day, that's not real work.

Now let's go through the internet era. Okay. Most of us have **lived through at least a portion of this** (/lɪvd θru æt liːst ə ˈpɔrʃən əv ðɪs/, 至少经历了一部分). And we see **all around us jobs that didn't exist before** (/ɔl əˈraʊnd ʌs dʒɑbz ðæt dɪdnt ɪɡˈzɪst bɪˈfɔr/, 身边有很多以前不存在的工作). Some of us are probably in them, maybe most of us. I know I am. So where does all this leave our 20 year old at the **dawn of the AI era** (/dɔn əv ði eɪ aɪ ˈɛrə/, AI时代的黎明) One feature that we found is **recurrent throughout generations** (/rɪˈkʌrənt θruˈaʊt ˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃənz/, 贯穿几代人反复出现). We'd like to think that somehow we're at a **discontinuity** (/ˌdɪskɑntɪˈnuːɪti/, 不连续性；中断), where history ends, and we're in a new world with no **precedent** (/ˈprɛsɪdənt/, 先例). And maybe it's true this time, we really don't know for building a super assistant or an **apex predator** (/ˈeɪpɛks ˈprɛdətər/, 顶级捕食者). We don't. And certainly all change and disruption brings with it a **painful transition** (/ˈpeɪnfəl trænˈzɪʃən/, 痛苦的过渡). Jobs will disappear, perhaps they'll disappear at an **accelerating rate** (/ækˈsɛləˌreɪtɪŋ reɪt/, 加速的速度). But at the same time, what we've gone through here is tens of thousands of years of human history. And we see one **undeniable trend** (/ˌʌndɪˈnaɪəbəl trɛnd/, 不可否认的趋势). There's going to be new jobs and lots and lots of them. AI researchers talk about this idea of a **singularity** (/ˌsɪŋɡjəˈlærəti/, 奇点), an intelligence explosion. But what we see in the data is that we're also on a curve of **rapidly accelerating job creation** (/ˌræpɪdli ækˈsɛləˌreɪtɪŋ dʒɑb kriˈeɪʃən/, 快速加速的就业创造), which I like to call the **job singularity** (/dʒɑb ˌsɪŋɡjəˈlærɪti/, 就业奇点), a **Cambrian explosion** (/ˈkæmbriən ɪkˈsploʊʒən/, 寒武纪大爆发) of not just new jobs, but new job families **across every imaginable field** (/əˈkrɔs ˈɛvri ɪˈmædʒɪnəbəl fiːld/, 跨越所有可想象的领域). So the internet gave people worldwide reach. AI gives them a world-class staff. And so if you look at this cloud of jobs, certainly there's going to be some jobs that we can't predict yet. But I think we can make some predictions. There's going to be a **flurry of new entrepreneurial activity** (/ˈflɜri əv nu ˌɑntrəprəˈnɜriəl ækˈtɪvɪti/, 大量的新的创业活动) with micro-corporations, solo institutions, and single-person unicorns, which by the way, I don't think we're very far from.

Another **defining feature** (/dɪˈfaɪnɪŋ ˈfiːtʃər/, 决定性特征) of this job singularity is that when you look into the future, the jobs will not **look like real work** (/lʊk laɪk rɪəl wɜrk/, 看起来像是真正的工作). Much like to our predecessors, our current jobs would have **looked like leisure** (/lʊkt laɪk ˈliːʒər/, 看起来像是休闲娱乐). We have people getting paid to play video games, eat at restaurants, travel, and talk to other friends on video. Those last people we call podcast bros. And we **take our jobs very seriously** (/teɪk ɑr dʒɑbz ˈvɛri ˈsɪəriəsli/, 非常认真对待我们的工作). Those of us that do well certainly wouldn't say it's easy. But if you took someone from the 20th century when people first started **contemplating these problems** (/ˈkɑntɛmˌpleɪtɪŋ ðiz ˈprɑbləmz/, 思考这些问题) and they could **peek into our world today** (/piːk ˈɪntu ɑr wɜrld təˈdeɪ/, 窥视我们今天的世界), they would think that all of the predictions around **technological unemployment** (/ˌtɛknəˈlɑdʒɪkəl ˌʌnɪmˈplɔɪmənt/, 技术性失业) came true. They'd say we don't have any more jobs. And I bet that we would feel the same about our **descendants** (/dɪˈsɛndənts/, 后代) in the future. So now what? We've shown that there's going to be lots of jobs to choose from. Some would argue too many. And that the jobs along with the **flurry of new entrepreneurial activity** (/ˈflɜri əv nu ˌɑntrəprəˈnɜriəl ækˈtɪvɪti/, 大量的新的创业活动) will likely look like leisure to us. Much like our jobs did to our ancestors. And I can tell you with **near certainty** (/nɪr ˈsɜrtnti/, 几乎可以肯定) that a humanity that's capable of building a super intelligent AI also has the creativity to navigate through this potential job, **doom, and gloom scenario** (/dum æn ɡluːm sɪˈnɛriˌoʊ/, 悲观沮丧的局面). Although we'll never stop worrying about it. We'll never stop worrying about it. Because being **hyper vigilant about threats to our survival** (/ˈhaɪpər ˈvɪdʒələnt əˈbaʊt θrɛts tə ɑr sərˈvaɪvəl/, 对生存威胁高度警惕) is a **key part of our survival mechanism** (/ki pɑrt əv ɑr sərˈvaɪvəl ˈmɛkəˌnɪzəm/, 我们生存机制的关键部分), also a **key part of evolution** (/ki pɑrt əv ˌɛvəˈluːʃən/, 进化的关键部分), what makes us human. And although it'll take a lot of time to go into what kind of jobs our **future proved** (/ˈfjuːtʃər pruvd/, (原文如此，可能为“future-proofed”的口语表达或笔误，意为“未来可期的”或“经受得住未来考验的”) ) I can tell you that you shouldn't take predictions about future job disruption to **keep you from doing something you feel very passionately about** (/kiːp ju frəm ˈduːɪŋ ˈsʌmˌθɪŋ ju fiːl ˈvɛri ˈpæʃənətli əˈbaʊt/, 阻止你做你充满热情的事情). You know when I was a kid in the 90s, teachers **discouraged me from becoming** (/dɪsˈkɜrɪdʒd mi frəm bɪˈkʌmɪŋ/, 劝阻我成为) a computer programmer. I don't know if many else heard this. But back then it was a **common thought** (/ˈkɑmən θɔt/, 普遍的看法) that all those jobs would be **shipped off to China** (/ʃɪpt ɔf tə ˈtʃaɪnə/, 转移到中国). Around the same time, if you guys remember, 1997, Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov in chess. That was the first time an AI **succeeded in what was considered a solely human intellectual fair** (/səkˈsiːdɪd ɪn wʌt wəz kənˈsɪdərd ə ˈsoʊli ˈhjuːmən ˌɪntəˈlɛktʃuəl fɛr/, 在被认为是纯粹人类智力竞赛的领域取得了成功). But now the chess industry is **booming bigger than ever** (/ˈbuːmɪŋ ˈbɪɡər ðæn ˈɛvər/, 比以往任何时候都更加蓬勃发展). So even where it seems obvious, sometimes our predictions of the future **end up being completely off** (/ɛnd ʌp ˈbiːɪŋ kəmˈpliːtli ɔf/, 最终完全错误). Humanity has always **excelled at providing itself with meaning and purpose** (/ɪkˈsɛld æt prəˈvaɪdɪŋ ɪtˈsɛlf wɪð ˈmiːnɪŋ æn ˈpɜrpəs/, 擅长为自己提供意义和目标), even in the darkest and most uncertain of times. So if I had to guess, I feel very, very confident that the 20-year-olds of the future, perhaps in collaboration with AI, will continue to build new things, which **simultaneously** (/ˌsaɪməlˈteɪniəsli/, 同时地) we're going to be scared of, but also excited by. Thank you for considering these ideas.
