### 1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

You're listening to Ted Duck's Daily where we **bring you new ideas** (带来新想法) to **spark your curiosity** (激发你的好奇心) every day. I'm your host, Elise Hugh. I'm still amazed by the **ridiculously fast pace** (惊人的快速) that wish technology and AI is growing. But what are some ways that AI might be used for climate and nature solutions? Today, Manoj Zomarodi, who hosts the Ted Radio Hour, **sits down with** (采访) AI **Changemaker** (/ˈtʃeɪndʒˌmeɪkər/, 变革者), Amen, Ra, Masheriki. To **discuss what he thinks** (讨论他认为的) **truly game changing climate ideas** (真正具有颠覆性的气候理念) might look like and how AI is playing an **increasingly large role** (越来越重要的角色) in that space.

Okay, so tell us the story of how you **got to be working with** (开始与…合作) Bezos. You're sort of **trajectory** (/trəˈdʒɛktəri/, 发展轨迹) to being here. Yeah, it's really interesting that you asked that question because sort of my **pathway to** (通往…的途径) the Bezos Earth Fund is almost **polar opposite** (/ˈpoʊlər ˈɒpəzɪt/, 完全相反) to how we think about our pathway to **adopting and using AI** (采纳和使用人工智能) to **accelerate climate and nature solutions** (加速气候和自然解决方案). And I'll explain why really, really in some **quick points** (几个要点). I undergrad masters, doctorate, computer science, computer scientists, research labs, **did the whole thing** (完成了所有这些). I was one of those computer scientists that **believed in** (相信) computer science, you know, **algorithm optimization** (/ˈælɡərɪðəm ˌɒptɪmaɪˈzeɪʃən/, 算法优化). Through a couple of **personal things that took place** (发生的一些个人事件), I realized that that was only a **mechanism by which** (实现…的机制) I could do other things, which is **having impact** (产生影响). So then I began to **chase problems** (追逐问题/解决问题). You mentioned here, I was the **chief analytics officer** (/tʃiːf ˌænəˈlɪtɪks ˈɒfɪsər/, 首席数据分析官) for the city of New York. How do we **solve problems** (解决问题) here? And then, you know, **coming to** (来到) the Bezos Earth Fund, how do we use AI, computer science to solve climate and nature problems? I was AI **in search of a problem** (寻找问题) at the Bezos Earth Fund. We **think about starting with the problem first** (考虑先从问题入手) and **understanding that problem** (理解问题) and then **looking for ways to use modern AI** (寻找使用现代人工智能的方法) in order to **scale solutions** (扩大解决方案) in that space.

Okay, so let's **go deeper into that** (深入探讨). How are you looking at different projects that are **out there** (在那里的)? What are sort of the **big ideas** (大想法) that you're using to sort of **lead you to find** (引导你找到) what you want to **fund** (/fʌnd/, 资助)? Yeah, so internally we have a **mental model** (/ˈmɛntəl ˈmɒdl/, 思维模型) that we use to really **get there** (达到目标). We think about this difference between **inventions** (/ɪnˈvɛnʃənz/, 发明) and **discoveries** (/dɪˈskʌvəriz/, 发现), right? And the way you want to **think about that** (思考这个问题) is a telescope is an invention **looking through** (透过…看) the telescope to **notice that** (注意到) Jupiter has moons is the discovery, right? And so for us, when we **look at it** (看待它), it's how do we **identify big, big innovations** (识别重大创新), **grand innovations** (/ɡrænd ˌɪnəˈveɪʃənz/, 宏大创新) that **have an impact** (产生影响) such that you can have discoveries that then have an impact in climate and nature. And so we **look for projects and efforts** (寻找项目和努力) that sort of **go across that mental model** (符合那个思维模型).

Okay, so before we **get into** (进入) the discovery part, let's talk about the tool. Where are we when it **comes to AI** (谈到人工智能)? I mean, I know there are some people who might think, what do you mean? We're at ChatGPT5. But like from your **perspective** (/pərˈspɛktɪv/, 视角), much different, where do you think we are? Yeah, so I could **spend hours talking about** (花好几小时谈论) digital twins, earth observation models, **edge AI** (边缘人工智能) and all those things. One of the things that have **resonated with me** (与我产生共鸣) is this **concept** (/ˈkɒnsɛpt/, 概念) called move 37. So move 37 was this move that AlphaGo, when **playing against** (对抗) Go champion **early on in the game** (在比赛初期), in this 37th move **did a move that was counterintuitive** (走出了一步反直觉的棋) to all experts. It **made no sense** (毫无意义) to any Go expert, but it was the move that **ultimately won the game** (最终赢得了比赛). And so where AI is, is these two places right now, it's at a place where it **answers questions based on what it knows** (根据已知信息回答问题). It **takes an average of reality** (取现实的平均值) and then gives you answers. Move 37 was this view into how AI can be **creative** (/kriˈeɪtɪv/, 有创造力的) and actually **come up with** (提出) a move that no one has ever **thought of** (想到) and was counterintuitive to use. And so we really want to **get to a place where** (达到一个境界) in climate and nature, AI is actually **offering solutions** (提供解决方案), creative solutions that even the world's greatest experts **find counterintuitive** (觉得反直觉), but actually really **powerful** (/ˈpaʊərfəl/, 强大的).

Do you have an example of something that's maybe **happening already** (已经在发生) that **demonstrates that** (证明这一点)? Well, one of the projects that really **goes across this mental model** (符合这个思维模型) that I talked about is Meta really **came up with** (提出了) this AI innovation invention called dyno v3, which is a **computer vision model** (计算机视觉模型), very powerful computer vision model. And then they **matched it with** (将其与…匹配) satellite data. And it's a really powerful **brain innovation** (大脑创新，这里可能是口误，应为 "grand innovation"), but what they did was **partner with** (与…合作) WRI in its **restoration efforts** (恢复工作) such that you could actually **track the growth of trees** (追踪树木的生长) to a 80% **accuracy** (/ˈækjərəsi/, 准确度) of **field surveys** (实地调查) at 3% of the cost. And so now you can actually **unlock performance based financing** (解锁基于绩效的融资) with this technology. So it **followed that mental model** (遵循那个思维模型) of grand innovation and invention and **ultimately a discovery** (最终的发现) that **leads to an impact** (带来影响).

The move 37, the whole thing about that is we **haven't gotten here yet** (还没达到这个地步). And that's where we should be **going, which is** (应该努力的方向是) there are restoration solutions that people are using. And if you ask AI, **tell me some of the best ways** (告诉我一些最好的方法) to do restoration in this **particular area** (特定区域). What it's going to do is **identify an average or interpolation of the existing good solutions** (识别现有优秀解决方案的平均值或插值). What we want is AI to **come up with something that no one in the room can come up with** (提出一些房间里没人能想到的东西) when it comes to restoration. And that's that's the **trajectory** (/trəˈdʒɛktəri/, 发展轨迹).

What's the **timeline look for that** (这方面的时间线是怎样的)? How will we know when we have sort of **hit that tipping point** (达到那个转折点)? One, there has to be **trust** (/trʌst/, 信任) and by the experts and the experts are using it. But then also there has to be a **mechanism by which** (实现…的机制) every day people who are living their lives, who are living in these regions that we're **concerned about** (关心), who are **doing the work on the ground** (在实地工作) can trust and use these tools as well. There is anyone who gives you an **exact number** (确切数字), **doesn't know the number** (不知道这个数字). How long it's going to take. But that's where we **have to get to** (必须达到) is that **level of trust** (信任水平) and that **level of use** (使用水平) **across a number of types of people** (跨越不同类型人群).

I want to **be sure to ask you** (一定要问你) because there are many people who say that the **same tech giants** (同样的科技巨头) who are **driving AI** (推动人工智能) are also **responsible for** (对…负责) a lot of the **environmental harms** (环境危害). And that their **climate initiatives** (气候倡议) **essentially amount to greenwashing** (实质上等同于“洗绿”). How do you **respond to that** (回应这个)? You know, at the Basel Surfernd, we **believe that** (相信) **on balance** (总的来说), AI is going to be a **tool and a force for good** (有利工具) and a **tool and a force for saving the planet** (拯救地球的工具和力量) or balance. We **have to acknowledge that** (必须承认) AI **does contribute to degradation** (确实导致退化) and **challenges** (/ˈtʃælɪndʒɪz/, 挑战) when it **comes to the environment** (谈到环境). There are many, many solutions that a lot of these companies, a lot of NGOs, a lot of academic institutions and a lot of governments are **applying in this space** (应用于这个领域). And we will continue as the Basel Surfernd to **support those type of efforts** (支持这类努力) such that we are **deliberate in meeting that broad statement** (有意识地履行那个泛泛的声明) that AI **on balance will have a positive impact** (总体上会产生积极影响) on the planet.

I mean, it **makes me nervous** (让我紧张) because it's like, let's **hope it works** (希望它奏效) a little bit. What are some of the sort of **milestones** (/ˈmaɪlˌstoʊnz/, 里程碑) that we need to be **looking for** (寻找) as we **go forward** (前进)? So, I was listening to a panel the other day and someone **said something along the lines of** (说了类似的话), every time you do a **query on chat GPT** (在ChatGPT上进行查询), it's like **throwing away a bottle of water on the ground** (把一瓶水扔在地上). And as soon as they said, **made that statement** (做出那个陈述), they said, you know, I don't know if that's true, but it **sounds like it might be true** (听起来可能是真的). One of the things that we need to **begin to do** (开始做) is to have **precise accuracy** (/prɪˈsaɪs ˈækjərəsi/, 精确的准确性) and understanding of exactly the **impact that AI is having on our environment** (人工智能对我们环境产生的影响) and a **shared understanding across the board** (全面的共识), such that we can **make statements that we all agree on** (做出我们都同意的声明) such that we can **identify the solutions** (识别解决方案). So, the first milestone, which will include a **level of transparency** (透明度), a lot of **information and data** (信息和数据), such that we can really **get to a place of agreeing on** (达成共识) exactly what those challenges are. The next milestone is because as we speak, companies are **shifting how they build technology** (正在改变他们构建技术的方式) to **support AI** (支持人工智能), for instance. **Cooling is no longer just cooling at the data center level** (冷却不再仅仅是数据中心层面的冷却) has **shifted to now** (已经转向) there are **mechanisms where you can cool at the chip level** (可以在芯片层面进行冷却的机制), such that the **burden on water** (水资源负担) is not so great. So, these are the types of milestones that would **have to be in place** (必须到位).

So, I guess I want to **end by saying** (最后说一句), you know, it's an **exciting time** (激动人心的时刻), it's a **scary time** (令人恐惧的时刻). What is getting you sort of what **makes you most hopeful** (让你最充满希望)? What are you **most excited about** (最兴奋) when you **get up every day** (每天起床) to **go figure out how we're going to find solutions** (去弄清楚如何找到解决方案)? So, let me say this, we believe that we're in a space where the **consequential decade** (/ˌkɒnsɪˈkwɛnʃəl ˈdɛkeɪd/, 具有重大影响的十年) meets the **decisive decade** (/dɪˈsaɪsɪv ˈdɛkeɪd/, 决定性十年). So, if you've heard that **term before** (这个术语), the consequential decade, it's what **AI practitioners** (/prækˈtɪʃənərz/, 人工智能从业者) use to talk about. This is the time in which we **have to think about** (必须思考) **ethics** (/ˈɛθɪks/, 伦理), **policy** (/ˈpɒləsi/, 政策), **regulation** (/ˌrɛɡjuˈleɪʃən/, 监管), **technology** (/tɛkˈnɒlədʒi/, 技术), **innovation** (/ˌɪnəˈveɪʃən/, 创新), **invention** (/ɪnˈvɛnʃən/, 发明), because these are the decisions that are going to decide, these are the things that are going to **decide where what impact AI has** (决定人工智能会产生什么影响) on the **global community** (/ˈɡloʊbəl kəˈmjuːnɪti/, 全球社区). And we all know here what the decisive decade of **reference is** (指的是什么). And so, this is a place where the consequential decade meets the decisive decade. And so, it really has to be an **all hands on deck** (全体人员出动) and a **commitment from communities** (社区的承诺) in the AI space and communities in the climate and nature space. And the Basil Sur Fund, we **see ourselves as sitting right in the middle** (我们认为自己正处于中心) and **being a leader in that space** (成为该领域的领导者).

We'll have to **leave it there** (就此打住). Amen, Rah Mahariji. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
