## 1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

**Segment 1: Advertisement - Save the Children**

Every day, 6,000 newborn babies don't **make it past** (未能度过) their first day. Most of these deaths are **preventable** (/prɪˈvɛntəbəl/, 可预防的), with medicine, clean water and skilled care. Even in war zones and disaster areas, save the children's mobile clinics are helping mothers **bring life into the world** (将生命带到世上) **against all odds** (克服重重困难/在极其不利的情况下). This season, you can help a baby **take their first safe breath** (第一次安全呼吸). Donate now at savethichildrun.net, **forward slash** (/ˈfɔrwərd slæʃ/, 斜杠) winter, or follow the **link in the show notes** (节目注释中的链接). Your gift can **save a life** (挽救生命) today.

**Segment 2: Advertisement - Vanta Security**

Your self wear needs to be **compliant** (/kəmˈplaɪənt/, 符合的) to **end deals** (完成交易), but you also need your engineers **focused on** (专注于) building your product, not pulling sock to evidence. **Enter a third option** (出现第三种选择), make Vanta your first security hire. Vanta uses AI and automation to get you **compliant fast** (快速合规), simplify your **audit process** (/ˈɔːdɪt ˈprɑːsɛs/, 审计流程) and **unblock deals** (解除交易障碍). So you can **prove to customers** (向客户证明) that you take security seriously. Plus, Vanta **scales right along with you** (随你一同扩展), **backed by support** (有支持作后盾) that's there when you need it **every step of the way** (在每一步). That's why top startups like Kerasa, linear and replete use Vanta to get and **stay secure** (保持安全). Don't sock lock your best engineer, **set them free** (解放他们) and get compliant fast with Vanta. **Get started at** (开始使用) Vanta.com.

**Segment 3: TED Talk Introduction - AI and Language**

You're listening to Ted Talks daily where we **bring you new ideas** (为您带来新想法) to **spark your curiosity** (/spɑːrk jʊər ˌkjʊəriˈɒsəti/, 激发你的好奇心) every day. I'm your host, Elise Hume. Is AI changing the **very way we talk** (我们说话的方式)? Etymologist (/ˌɛtɪˈmɑlədʒɪst/, 词源学家) and **content creator** (/ˈkɒntɛnt ˈkreɪətər/, 内容创作者) Adam Alexis **sounds the alarm on** (就...发出警告) how AI tools are **influencing our behavior** (影响我们的行为). **Down to our very word choices** (甚至影响我们的措辞), he encourages us to remember that these **emerging tools** (新兴工具) are not **neutral** (/ˈnuːtrəl/, 中立的) and how they are possibly **rewiring** (/ˌriːˈwaɪərɪŋ/, 重新连接/改造) the **very underlying patterns** (最根本的模式) of our thoughts and why. Afterward, I **sat down with** (与...坐下来交谈) Adam to **go beyond his talk** (超越他的演讲内容) and learn more about what **sounding human** (听起来像人类) even means anymore. The tools will need to build as we **continue down this rapidly changing path** (继续走在这条快速变化的道路上) and more. **Stick around** (留下来) after his talk for our conversation.

**Segment 4: The Perception Gap and AI Bias**

How **sure are you** (你有多确定) that you can **tell what's real online** (分辨网上什么是真实的)? You might think it's easy to **spot an obviously AI generated image** (识别一个明显由AI生成的图像) and you're probably **aware that** (意识到) algorithms are **biased** (/ˈbaɪəst/, 有偏见的) in some way. But all the evidence is **suggesting that** (表明) we're **pretty bad at understanding that** (很不擅长理解这一点) on a **subconscious level** (/ˌsʌbˈkɒnʃəs ˈlɛvəl/, 潜意识层面). **Take for example** (举例来说) the growing **perception gap** (/pərˈsɛpʃən ɡæp/, 认知差距) in America. We **keep over and over estimating** (一次又一次地高估) how **extreme** (/ɪkˈstriːm/, 极端的) other people's political beliefs are and this is **only getting worse with** (只会因...而变得更糟) social media because algorithms show us the most extreme picture of reality. As an etymologist and content creator I always see **controversial messages** (/ˌkɒntrəˈvɜːrʃəl ˈmɛsɪdʒɪz/, 有争议的信息) **go more viral** (更广泛传播) because they **generate more engagement** (/ˈdʒɛnəreɪt mɔːr ɪnˈɡeɪdʒmənt/, 产生更多互动) than a **neutral perspective** (中立观点). But that means we all **end up seeing** (最终看到) this more extreme version of reality and we're **clearly starting to confuse that with actual reality** (显然开始将其与真实世界混淆).

**Segment 5: AI Chatbots and Language Distortion - The "Delve" Example**

The same thing is **currently happening with** (目前正在发生) AI chat bots because you probably **assume that** (假定) chat chat is speaking English to you. Except it's not speaking English **in the same way that** (正如...) the algorithms not showing you reality. There are always **distortions** (/dɪˈstɔːrʃənz/, 扭曲) **depending on what goes into the model** (取决于模型输入的内容) and how it's trained. Like we know that chat chat chat says **delve** (/dɛlv/, 深入探究) at **way higher rates than usual** (比平时高得多), possibly because open AI **outsourced its training process** (外包了其训练过程) to workers in Nigeria who do actually say delve more frequently. **Over time though** (然而随着时间推移) that little **linguistic overrepresentation** (/lɪŋˈɡwɪstɪk ˌoʊvərˌrɛprɪzɛnˈteɪʃən/, 语言过度呈现) got **reinforced into the model** (被加强到模型中) even more than in the workers **own dialects** (/ˈdaɪəlɛkts/, 方言). Now that's **affecting everybody's language** (影响每个人的语言). Multiple studies have found that since chat chat chat came out people ever have insane the word delve more in **spontaneous spoken conversation** (/spɑnˈteɪniəs ˈspoʊkən ˌkɒnvərˈseɪʃən/, 自发口语交流). **Essentially** (/ɪˈsɛnʃəli/, 本质上), we're **subconsciously confusing** (潜意识地混淆) the AI version of language with actual language. But that means that the real thing is **ironically getting closer to** (讽刺地变得更接近) the machine version of the thing. We're in a **positive feedback loop** (/ˈpɑːzɪtɪv ˈfiːdbæk luːp/, 正反馈循环) with the AI representing reality, us thinking that's the real reality and then **regurgitating it** (/rɪˈɡɜːrdʒɪteɪtɪŋ ɪt/, 反刍它/重复它) so that the AI can be **fed more of our data** (获得更多我们的数据).

**Segment 6: Algorithms and Cultural Trends - The "Hyperpop" Example**

You can also see this happening with the algorithm through words like hyperpop, which wasn't really **part of our cultural lexicon** (/pɑːrt əv aʊr ˈkʌltʃərəl ˈlɛksɪkɑn/, 我们文化词汇的一部分) until Spotify **noticed an emerging cluster of similar users** (注意到了一群新兴的相似用户) in their algorithm. As soon as they **identified it** (识别出它) and **introduced a hyperpop playlist** (推出了一个超流行音乐播放列表) however the **aesthetic was given a direction** (/ɛsˈθɛtɪk wəz ˈɡɪvən ə dɪˈrɛkʃən/, 审美被赋予了一个方向). Now people began to **debate what did and did not qualify as hyperpop** (争论什么符合或不符合超流行音乐的定义). The label and the playlist **made the phenomenon more real** (让这种现象更真实) by **giving them something to identify with or against** (给他们认同或反对的东西) and as more people identified with hyperpop more musicians also started making hyperpop music. **All the while** (与此同时) the cluster of similar listeners and the algorithm **grew larger and larger** (变得越来越大) and Spotify **kept pushing it more and more** (不断地更大力地推广它) because these platforms want to **amplify cultural trends** (/ˈæmplɪfaɪ ˈkʌltʃərəl trɛndz/, 放大文化趋势) to **keep you on the app** (让你留在应用程序上). But that means we also **lose the distinction between** (失去...之间的区别) a real trend and an **artificially inflated trend** (/ˌɑːrtɪˈfɪʃəli ɪnˈfleɪtɪd trɛnd/, 人为夸大的趋势). And yet this is how all **fads** (/fædz/, 时尚/潮流) now **enter the mainstream** (进入主流).

**Segment 7: Algorithms and Misrepresentation of Reality**

We start with a **latent cultural desire** (/ˈleɪtənt ˈkʌltʃərəl dɪˈzaɪər/, 潜在的文化渴望) like maybe some people are interested in Macha or LaBoubou or Dubai chocolate. The algorithm **identifies this desire** (识别出这种渴望) and **pushes it to similar users** (将其推送给相似用户) **making the phenomenon more of a thing** (使这种现象变得更普遍). But again just like how chat TPPT **misrepresent of the word delv** (误报了“delve”这个词), the algorithm is probably **misrepresenting reality** (/ˌmɪsrɛprɪˈzɛntɪŋ riˈæləti/, 歪曲现实). Now more businesses are making LaBoubou content because they **think that's the desire** (认为那是人们的渴望). More influencers are also making LaBoubou trends because we have to **tap into trends** (利用趋势) to **go viral** (走红/病毒式传播). And yet the algorithm is only showing you the **visually provocative items** (/ˈvɪʒuəli prəˈvɑkətɪv ˈaɪtəmz/, 视觉上引人注目的项目) that **work in the video format** (适用于视频格式). TikTok has a **limited idea of who you are as a user** (对你作为用户的了解有限) and there's **no way that matches up with** (绝不可能与...相符) your **complex desires** (/ˈkɒmplɛks dɪˈzaɪərz/, 复杂的欲望) as a human being so we have a **biased input** (/ˈbaɪəst ˈɪnˌpʊt/, 有偏见的输入). And that's **assuming that** (假定) social media is trying to **faithfully represent reality** (/ˈfeɪθfəli ˌrɛprɪˈzɛnt riˈæləti/, 忠实地呈现现实) which it isn't. Instead it's only trying to **do what's going to make money for them** (做能让他们赚钱的事情). It's **in Spotify's interest to have you listening to hyperpop** (Spotify希望你听超流行音乐符合其利益) and it's **in TikTok's interest to have you looking at LaBoubou's** (TikTok希望你关注LaBoubou符合其利益) because that's **commodifiable** (/kəˈmɑdɪfaɪəbəl/, 可商品化的). So **once again** (再一次) we have this **difference between reality and the representation of reality** (现实与现实表征之间的差异) where they're actually **constantly influencing one to another** (持续相互影响). But it's **incredibly dangerous to ignore that distinction** (忽略这种区别极其危险) because this **goes beyond our language** (超出我们的语言) and our **consumptive behaviors** (/kənˈsʌmptɪv bɪˈheɪvjərz/, 消费行为). This affects the world we **see as possible** (认为可能的).

**Segment 8: Political Implications and the Call to Question**

Evidence suggests that chat TPPT is more **conservative** (/kənˈsɜːrvətɪv/, 保守的) when speaking the **farcey language** (波斯语) likely because the **limited training text** (有限的训练文本) in Iran **reflect the more conservative political climate** (反映了更保守的政治气候) in the region. Does that mean that an Iranian chat TPPT user will **think more conservative thoughts** (思想更保守)? We know that Elon Musk **regularly makes changes to his chatbot** (定期修改他的聊天机器人), Brock, when he **doesn't like how it's responding** (不喜欢它的回应方式). And that he uses his platform X to **artificially amplify his tweets** (人为放大他的推文). Does that mean that the millions of Brock and X users are **subconsciously being trained to align with Musk's ideology** (/ˌsʌbˈkɒnʃəsli biːɪŋ treɪnd tu əˈlaɪn wɪð ˈmʌsks ˌaɪdiˈɑlədʒi/, 潜意识地被训练以与马斯克的意识形态保持一致)? We need to **constantly remember that** (不断记住) these aren't **neutral tools** (中立工具). Everything that **ends up in your social media feed** (最终出现在你的社交媒体动态中) or in your chatbot responses is actually **filtered through many layers of** (经过多层过滤) what's **good for the platform** (对平台有利), what **makes money** (赚钱), and what **conforms to the platform's incorrect idea** (符合平台不正确的观念) about who you are. When we ignore this, we **view reality through a constant survivorship bias** (/vjuː riˈæləti θruː ə ˈkɒnstənt sərˈvaɪvərʃɪp ˈbaɪəs/, 通过持续的幸存者偏差看待现实) which affects our **understanding of the world** (对世界的理解). **After all** (毕竟), if you're talking more like chat TPPT, you're probably **thinking more like chat TPPT** (思考方式更像ChatGPT) as well. Or take talk or Spotify, but you can **fight this if you constantly ask yourself why** (如果你不断问自己为什么，你就可以对抗它)? **Why am I seeing this** (我为什么会看到这个)? **Why am I saying this** (我为什么会这么说)? **Why am I thinking this** (我为什么会这么想)? And **why is the platform rewarding this** (为什么平台会奖励这个)? If you don't **ask yourself these questions** (问自己这些问题), their **version of reality** (版本的现实) is **going to become your version of reality** (将成为你的现实版本). So **stay real** (保持真实). Don't **go away just yet** (不要马上离开). **Stick around** (留下来). My conversation with Adam is **coming up right after a short break** (稍事休息后马上开始) with **word from our sponsors** (赞助商的广告).

**Segment 9: Interview - Origin of Curiosity about Language**

**Congratulations on your talk** (恭喜你的演讲). How are you **feeling now that you're done** (现在演讲完了感觉如何)? **Tell us what made you so curious about language** (告诉我们是什么让你对语言如此好奇) **in the first place** (最初)? And how you **got hooked** (迷上了/上瘾了). Yeah, wow. Etymology **in particular** (特别是), I always like to **tell people** (告诉人们). It **comes from the Greek word** (来自希腊词) etymos, **meaning truth** (意为真相). So you look at etymology and you're actually **studying truth** (研究真相). You're **studying how humans understand the world** (研究人类如何理解世界), how we **relate that to other people** (将其与他人联系起来). In software, your high school, I **read this etymology book** (读了这本词源学书), I **got super into it** (非常投入). And then I just started like **really studying it more for myself** (真正为自己更深入地研究它). I **started a little website** (建立了一个小网站) in high school. I **studied linguistics** (/lɪŋˈɡwɪstɪks/, 语言学) in college. And then I was **graduating with a linguistics degree** (获得了语言学学位) and I was like, well, **what do I do now** (我现在该做什么)? So I **started making linguistics content** (开始制作语言学内容). And then **actively sort of studying the language of the social media space** (积极研究社交媒体领域的语言) as I was in it. And then **wrote a book**, Algo Speak, **on how social media is changing language** (关于社交媒体如何改变语言). And then that **ended up getting me the TED Talk** (最终让我获得了TED演讲机会).

**Segment 10: Language Evolution and Medium Constraints**

Is there a **problem with social media changing language** (社交媒体改变语言有问题吗) because our language has **always evolved** (一直在演变)? This is a **living and dynamic thing** (/ˈlɪvɪŋ ænd daɪˈnæmɪk θɪŋ/, 活生生且充满活力的事物), right? English or any other language in the world. So **is there anything wrong with it** (这有什么问题吗)? No. And our language has **always evolved around the constraints of a medium** (总是围绕着媒介的限制而演变), right? Before we had written history, we would **rely on oral tradition** (/rɪˈlaɪ ɒn ˈɔːrəl trəˈdɪʃən/, 依赖口头传统). We would **tell stories through rhyme and meter** (/tɛl ˈstɔːriz θruː raɪm ænd ˈmiːtər/, 通过韵律和格律讲故事). And then we started **writing things down** (记录下来). The places that used leaves to write things down **developed curly scripts** (/dɪˈvɛləpt ˈkɜːrli skrɪpts/, 发展出卷曲的文字) because that was **better for the leaves** (更适合叶子). And the places that used clay and stone to write things down **developed rigid scripts** (/dɪˈvɛləpt ˈrɪdʒɪd skrɪpts/, 发展出僵硬的文字). So again, the medium is **literally shaping language** (/ˈlɪtərəli ˈʃeɪpɪŋ ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/, 实际上塑造语言). We have chapter books. We have the internet. Internet **allows for this written replication of informal speech** (/əˈlaʊz fɔːr ðɪs ˈrɪtən ˌrɛplɪˈkeɪʃən əv ɪnˈfɔːrməl spiːtʃ/, 允许这种非正式口语的书面复制). It's again, **kind of a paradigm shift** (/kaɪnd əv ə ˈpærədaɪm ʃɪft/, 一种范式转变) in how we speak. And I think algorithms are that new **paradigm shift** (/ˈpærədaɪm ʃɪft/, 范式转变). AI is a new paradigm shift. We're in this like **really fast-paced moment** (/ˈrɪəli fɑːst peɪst ˈmoʊmənt/, 节奏非常快的时刻) where our language is **rerouting around these new mediums** (/ˌriːˈruːtɪŋ əˈraʊnd ðiːz nuː ˈmiːdiəmz/, 围绕这些新媒介重新路由) we're **interacting with** (互动).

**Segment 11: Managing the Speed of Change in Language**

Yeah, you mentioned **fast-paced** (/fɑːst peɪst/, 节奏快的) as an etymologist. How are you **managing the speed at which things are changing** (管理事物变化的速度)? Yeah. Well, it's **really good for me that I am kind of studying things in the open** (对我来说，我在开放环境中研究事物真的很好). I **make videos about phenomena I'm observing** (我制作关于我观察到的现象的视频). And then I **get tagged in videos** (在视频中被标记) where people are **using new words** (使用新词). It's **sort of crazy in that sense** (从这个意义上说有点疯狂). But I also **have to be in it** (也必须身临其境). I **scroll tiktok for a research** (我刷TikTok做研究). But you **have to be in the milieu** (/mɪlˈjuː/, 环境/氛围) to **really know what you're studying** (真正了解你正在研究什么). Everything's **contextual** (/kənˈtɛkstʃuəl/, 依语境而定的). There is an aesthetic that words are **evolving through** (通过...演变). There are communities that words are **evolving from** (从...演变). You **have to understand at least a little bit about internet culture** (你至少需要了解一点互联网文化) to **know about these communities** (了解这些社区) because they're **so much depth to them** (它们有如此多的深度).

**Segment 12: Short-Lived Trends and Gen Alpha Language**

Right. And it **strikes me that** (我突然想到) everything is changing. We're talking **just within a matter of days** (就在几天之内) a trend can **emerge** (/ɪˈmɜːrdʒ/, 出现) and then **be gone** (消失) and then **be considered passe or old** (/ˌpæsˈeɪ ɔːr oʊld/, 过时或老旧), which is at a **much faster cadence in speed** (快得多的节奏) than say academia, where language was **traditionally researched** (传统上被研究) and linguistics was studied. What do you **feel like are some trends this year in language** (你觉得今年语言有哪些趋势) that have **come up** (出现) and have **really hit the zeitgeist** (/hɪt ðə ˈzaɪtˌɡaɪst/, 真正触及时代精神) that you **have to explain the most** (需要解释得最多)? Yeah. Wow. Well, we're definitely **on the tail end of** (即将结束) 6th and I **feel like most people understand by now that** (我觉得大多数人现在已经明白) that's this **nonsensical interjection** (/nɑːnˈsɛnsɪkəl ˌɪntərˈdʒɛkʃən/, 无意义的感叹词) **coming from meme communities** (来自表情包社区) originally **parodying clip farming** (/ˈpærədiɪŋ klɪp ˈfɑːrmɪŋ/, 模仿视频片段收集). But there's been **so much going on yesterday** (昨天发生了很多事). I **made a video about** (我制作了一个关于...的视频) low can you and Lee. And I **guarantee you by the time that this podcast airs** (我向你保证，到这个播客播出时) that word will **already be passe** (已经过时了). But it's like a **combination of** (结合了) low key and genuinely and it's like true. Oh, genuinely. Yeah. Okay. It's not **going to stick** (会流行). It's like a **meme word** (/miːm wɜːrd/, 表情包词). But that's exactly kind of **illustrating how quickly these words come and go** (说明这些词出现和消失的速度有多快). I **really doubt that'll be around beyond like a month** (我真的怀疑它能流行超过一个月). Okay. I'm **trying to go through what I'm hearing in my house** (我正在努力理解我在家里听到的一切) that **sounds like nonsense** (听起来像废话) because I have a 13 year old and a 10 year old and a year old. No matter **how much you think you know** (无论你认为自己知道多少), they **know more** (知道更多). So I have friends who are middle school teachers. Sometimes they **let me sit on in their middle school classrooms** (让我旁听他们的中学课堂) and that's where you **really learn the culture** (真正学习文化) and then like **Gen Z older people parody their language** (Z世代年长者模仿他们的语言) and then it **becomes brain rot** (/breɪn rɑːt/, 脑烂/思维退化). But it **starts with Gen Alpha** (始于阿尔法世代).

**Segment 13: "Chat" as a Vocative and Digital Surveillance**

Yeah. I **do like being called chat though instead of mom** (我确实喜欢被叫“chat”而不是妈妈). Chat is funny and that's definitely a **phenomenon that's got way more popular this year** (今年流行得多的现象). I definitely **started seeing that around 2023** (我大约在2023年开始看到这种现象) sort of as like a **general vocative** (/ˈdʒɛnərəl ˈvɒkətɪv/, 普遍的称呼语). **What do we think chat** (我们怎么看，chat)? you know? And yeah, it **sort of reflects the rise of streaming culture** (有点反映了流媒体文化的兴起). And I've seen a lot of words **come out of twitched bases** (来自Twitch基础). **Back when Rizba's popular** (当Rizba流行的时候) that **came from Twitch** (来自Twitch). Oh, okay. So when I'm **referred to as chat** (我被称为“chat”), it's from like a **live streamer typically saying** (直播主通常会说) like, hey, **don't forget to subscribe** (别忘了订阅). Yeah. It's **addressing an unknown audience** (向未知观众讲话). You **know that there is an audience** (你知道有观众) you **don't know who's in the audience** (你不知道观众里有谁). Chat is a **catch all** (/kætʃ ɔːl/, 包罗万象的). There's a **sort of collective unity to it** (它有一种集体的统一性). And then there's also a sort of, yeah, the **strange dynamic of digital surveillance** (/streɪndʒ daɪˈnæmɪk əv ˈdɪdʒɪtəl sərˈveɪləns/, 数字监控的奇怪动态) where we **really don't know who's going to see a message** (真的不知道谁会看到一条信息), where it's **going to be distributed** (会被分发到哪里) even **on the surface level** (在表面层面). So **right now this will go somewhere** (现在它会传播到某个地方). But then **what if it goes viral** (如果它走红了呢) and then that will then **go in directions you don't know** (会走向你不知道的方向). That's also at 6.7 was **parroting at the core of it** (/ˈpærətɪŋ ət ðə kɔːr əv ɪt/, 核心是鹦鹉学舌) because it **comes from this joke that you could go viral by saying** (来自一个玩笑，说...就能走红) 6.7. So people said 6.7 to go viral. It was a **little self-referential** (/ˈlɪtəl sɛlf rɛfəˈrɛnʃəl/, 有点自指的) as a **nod to itself** (自我暗示). And then yeah, **Drifts from NBA players** (从NBA球员演变而来) who are saying this to go viral to **Jen Alpha kids** (阿尔法世代的孩子) who are saying this to go viral. And then it **goes off camera** (离开镜头). And now the **implied joke is still this possibility** (隐含的笑话仍然是这种可能性) that a camera is **watching you** (在监视你). And I think that's maybe a **defining trend** (/dɪˈfaɪnɪŋ trɛnd/, 决定性趋势) that I **keep seeing that** (我一直看到) we're **kind of aware of this constant surveillance or pinopticon** (我们有点意识到这种持续的监控或全景监狱). And we're **ironically performing for the algorithm** (/aɪˈrɒnɪkəli pərˈfɔːrmɪŋ fɔːr ði ˈælɡərɪðəm/, 讽刺地为算法表演) when we say 6.7. And the **early iteration of the joke now** (现在这个笑话的早期迭代), of course, it **just is layered in tipstraction** (只是被分层在抽象中).

**Segment 14: Aspiration to be Seen and Societal Effects**

Yeah. I mean, there's the **pinopticon element of it** (/ˈpɪnɒptɪkɒn ˈɛlɪmənt əv ɪt/, 全景监狱元素). But it also **strikes me as fascinating that** (令我着迷的是) so many young people today when you **ask them what they want to be when they grow up** (问他们长大后想做什么) is a YouTuber, right? Or to **go viral** (走红) or to be an influencer. So now our **life aspirations aren't a particular virtue** (人生抱负不再是一种特定的美德). But instead to **be seen** (被看到). I think it's like 50% or something. It's not just astronaut anymore. Right. We **want to be seen** (想被看到). And there's **more seeing going on** (有更多的“被看到”正在发生). I **kind of worry about the amount of seeing that we're doing** (我有点担心我们正在进行的“被看到”的程度). I was in Washington Square Park a few months back and I **saw somebody with like the meta glasses** (我看到有人戴着Meta眼镜) **trying to like make risk content** (试图制作有风险的内容). And he was like **talking up girls** (搭讪女孩). But like, it's not a **real assertation** (/rɪəl ˌæsərˈteɪʃən/, 真实的断言). He's **performing** (/pərˈfɔːrmɪŋ/, 表演). He's **clip farming** (/klɪp ˈfɑːrmɪŋ/, 收集视频片段), you know? I **see like politicians saying stuff that they know will algorithmically go viral later** (我看到政客们说一些他们知道以后会通过算法走红的东西). But **in the present moment** (在当下), they **sacrifice like a moment of decorum** (/ˈsækrɪfaɪs ə ˈmoʊmənt əv dɪˈkɔːrəm/, 牺牲了一刻的礼仪). I **do worry about what is the notion that we could all be perceived due to us** (我确实担心，我们都可以被感知的这种观念，会对我们产生什么影响). So **on one end** (一方面), you **could act out more** (可能会更放肆) because you **want to be perceived** (想被看到) **on the other end** (另一方面). It **makes you more docile** (/ˈdoʊsaɪl/, 温顺的) because you're **worried about being perceived** (担心被看到). They're **bad effects for society in both ways** (对社会有双重不良影响). And so we **can use words like six, seven or chat to point to what's happening in culture** (我们可以用“六七”或“聊天”这样的词来指出文化中正在发生的事情). And then **from there, we get into subjective territory** (从那里，我们进入了主观领域). Right. But I **do want to say that the words that people are using are merely a way to categorize reality** (我确实想说，人们使用的词语仅仅是分类现实的一种方式). And **in that sense** (从这个意义上说), they are **just a tool** (只是一个工具). A tool **can be used for good or bad** (可以用于好或坏). You can **draw your own conclusions about culture** (你可以对文化得出自己的结论).

**Segment 15: AI's Ambient Influence on Language**

In your talk, you **focus on how LLMs, large language models and chat body AIs are affecting speech** (你专注于大型语言模型和聊天AI如何影响言语), **affecting the way we talk** (影响我们说话的方式). How do you think it's **going to change our language practices in the future** (将来会如何改变我们的语言习惯)? Yeah. **Mostly stuff is happening ambiently right now** (目前大部分事情都在悄然发生). So first, we **observed an increase in the word delv** (我们观察到“delve”这个词的使用增加了) because chat GPT **over represents the word delv** (过度使用了“delve”这个词). And you know, **maybe you heard of that** (也许你听说过), maybe you heard that chat GPT says the word delv. Maybe you heard about like **sentence structures** (/ˈsɛntəns ˈstrʌktʃərz/, 句式). Like it's not just x. It's y. And you're **trying to avoid that** (试图避免那样). It's **still going to affect you** (仍然会影响你). There's **so many other words that it uses at a slightly higher rate** (还有许多其他词语它以略高的频率使用) like **surpass** (/sərˈpæs/, 超越) or **boast** (/boʊst/, 吹嘘) or **garner** (/ˈɡɑːrnər/, 获得). I don't know. I **call myself saying garner** (我发现自己说“garner”). I **don't know why I'm saying** (我不知道我为什么这么说), but you **see a word being used around you** (你看到一个词在你周围被使用) and you **use it more** (使用它更多). That's **how we adopt language** (我们就是这样学习语言的). And chat GPT and these other LLMs **represent language as like a series of numerical kind of coordinates** (将语言表示为一系列数值坐标). And these **representations are close perhaps to how we actually feel about words** (这些表示可能接近我们对词语的真实感受), but they **homogenize it** (/həˈmɑːdʒənaɪz ɪt/, 使其同质化) and they **get a little bit wrong** (有点错误) because **representation can never be reality** (表征永远不能是现实). So they **mess things up** (搞砸了). And now we have **new studies coming out showing that** (有新的研究表明) people, yes, in spontaneous spoken conversations, we're **using the word surpass and boast more simply because we see it more** (使用“surpass”和“boast”更多，仅仅因为我们看到它更多). We **absorb it** (/əbˈzɔːrb ɪt/, 吸收它). That's **how I think AI is botching me affecting our language** (我认为AI就是这样影响我们的语言的). I'm more I think **conscious of algorithms** (/ˈkɑnʃəs əv ˈælɡərɪðəmz/, 意识到算法). **Ideas really travel** (思想真的会传播). You can **visualize it like a virus infecting a population** (/ˈvɪʒuəlaɪz ɪt laɪk ə ˈvaɪrəs ɪnˈfɛktɪŋ ə ˌpɑpjʊˈleɪʃən/, 可以将其可视化为病毒感染人群). It **starts with a host** (/stɑːrts wɪð ə hoʊst/, 从宿主开始). It **goes to some early nodes in the network of social contagion** (/ɡoʊz tu sʌm ˈɜːrli noʊdz ɪn ðə ˈnɛtwɜːrk əv ˈsoʊʃəl kənˈteɪdʒən/, 传播到社会传染网络中的一些早期节点) and then it **diffuses further** (/dɪˈfjuːzɪz ˈfɜːrðər/, 进一步扩散). Algorithms **represent those social networks** (代表那些社交网络). They **do literally accelerate ideas** (/duː ˈlɪtərəli ækˈsɛləreɪt aɪˈdiːəz/, 确实加速了思想传播). So if we **want to think about how chat GPT is influencing language** (如果我们要思考ChatGPT如何影响语言), you **don't even have to be using AI to be affected by these words** (你甚至不必使用AI就会受到这些词语的影响) because they're **showing up all around us** (在我们周围无处不在). I'm thinking about, oh, now we **might be looking at more content on social media using the word delver something** (我们可能会在社交媒体上看到更多使用“delve”等词的内容). 14% of all research papers are now **written with AI** (由AI撰写). We have like **parliamentary speeches being written with AI** (/ˌpɑːrləˈmɛntəri spiːtʃɪz biːɪŋ ˈrɪtən wɪð eɪ aɪ/, 议会演讲由AI撰写). You're **going to see it more no matter how immune you think you are** (无论你认为自己有多免疫，你都会看到更多). And then you're **going to start saying it more** (然后你会开始说得更多).

**Segment 16: The Feedback Loop and Loss of Linguistic Diversity**

Yeah, it's this **loop** (/luːp/, 循环), right? It's this **unending fun house mirror** (/ʌnˈɛndɪŋ fʌn haʊs ˈmɪrər/, 无尽的哈哈镜) or **feedback loop of our language** (我们语言的反馈循环). We **feed it** (我们喂养它). It **feeds us back to us from like an aggregated data set** (/fiːdz ʌs bæk tu ʌs frəm laɪk ən ˈæɡrɪɡeɪtɪd ˈdeɪtə sɛt/, 它从聚合数据集中反馈给我们). Right. So **what are we losing** (我们正在失去什么)? Yeah, if our **language practices are sort of undifferentiated** (/ˈlænɡwɪdʒ ˈpræktɪsɪz ɑːr sɔːrt əv ˌʌndɪfəˈrɛnʃieɪtɪd/, 我们的语言习惯变得模糊不清), we're **losing the individual quirks or flare that can be in language** (/ˈluːzɪŋ ði ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəl kwɜːrks ɔːr flɛər ðæt kæn biː ɪn ˈlænɡwɪdʒ/, 失去语言中可能存在的独特怪癖或风格) or slang or **intricacies of dialects** (/ˈɪntrɪkəsɪz əv ˈdaɪəlɛkts/, 方言的复杂性). Are we **losing connection to each other** (失去彼此的联系)? Are we **losing connection to a certain culture** (失去与某种文化的联系)? **What's the cost of this** (这有什么代价)? Yeah, with language again, this is a way to **reflect our reality** (/rɪˈflɛkt aʊr riˈæləti/, 反映我们的现实) and our reality is **not purely this algorithmic AI reality** (并非纯粹是这种算法AI现实). You **will have a different dialect always with your close friends** (你总是会和你的密友使用不同的方言) with your family. You will speak, you will **code switch between your regional dialect and then this homogenized AI dialect** (/koʊd swɪtʃ bɪˈtwiːn jʊər ˈriːdʒənəl ˈdaɪəlɛkt ænd ðɛn ðɪs həˈmɑːdʒənaɪzd eɪ aɪ ˈdaɪəlɛkt/, 在你的地方方言和这种同质化的AI方言之间进行语码转换), whatever that we were all **talking in** (在其中交流). But yeah, you'll **always find different ways to communicate given the context** (鉴于语境，你总是会找到不同的交流方式). It's **not a categorical homogenization of language** (/nɑːt ə ˌkætɪˈɡɔːrɪkəl həˌmɑːdʒənaɪˈzeɪʃən əv ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/, 不是语言的彻底同质化). But **in the domain of public speech** (/ɪn ðə doʊˈmeɪn əv ˈpʌblɪk spiːtʃ/, 在公共言论领域), I think we are **kind of traveling towards a norm** (有点走向一种常态). There's also a **really good book by Kyle Chakka called Filter World** (凯尔·查卡写了一本非常好的书叫《过滤世界》) about how algorithms **sort of dilute culture down** (/sɔːrt əv daɪˈluːt ˈkʌltʃər daʊn/, 有点稀释文化). I think that's **very much happening** (非常普遍). And so that will be happening with language. We **have a language dying out every two weeks** (每两周就有一种语言消亡). There's only 7,000 in the world. Every two weeks one goes. And this was **happening before** (之前就在发生), I think. The internet **perhaps accelerated it** (/pərˈhæps ækˈsɛləreɪtɪd ɪt/, 或许加速了它), but **globalization already kickstarted it** (/ˌɡloʊbəlɪˈzeɪʃən ɔːlˈrɛdi ˈkɪkstɑːrtɪd ɪt/, 全球化已经启动了它) by **nationalizing and centralizing our languages** (/ˈnæʃənəlaɪzɪŋ ænd ˈsɛntrəlaɪzɪŋ aʊr ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒɪz/, 使我们的语言国家化和中心化). We were **on this path since like the 1850s** (自19世纪50年代以来就走在这条路上). But it's **definitely happening even more with algorithms** (肯定在算法的作用下发生得更厉害), which are **more of this force for homogeneity** (/mɔːr əv ðɪs fɔːrs fɔːr ˌhɑːməˈdʒɛnɪti/, 更多的是这种同质化的力量) because there's an **expectation that users have of like, oh, I watch you be speaking in American English or in British English or whatever** (用户有一种期望，比如“哦，我看到你用美式英语或英式英语说话，或其他语言”). So that's like **one effect that's certainly happening** (这肯定是一种正在发生的影响). I **do not think it's going to be happening in every sphere of your life** (我不认为它会在你生活的各个领域都发生), but it's **going to be influencing you** (它会影响你). And that's **really sad because with some of these dying languages are such incredible perspectives for looking at the world** (这真的很悲伤，因为一些正在消亡的语言提供了看待世界的独特视角). There are like these different frames. I **was just reading this book, Braiding Sweetgrass** (我刚读了《与甜草编织》这本书). I **highly recommend it** (/ˈhaɪli ˌrɛkəˈmɛnd ɪt/, 强烈推荐). There's this bottom with Tommy Word to be a Saturday. So like we **don't have the verb idea of being a Saturday** (我们没有“是星期六”这种动词概念). But I **really like that is a frame you can look at Saturdays through** (我真的很喜欢，那是一个你可以用来审视星期六的视角). Different languages have **different understandings of time and direction** (对时间和方向有不同的理解). And the **more you condense down into this like sort of Western centric view we got going on** (你越是浓缩成我们现在这种以西方为中心的观点), you **lose the color and the beauty of all these different ways we could look at the world** (你就会失去我们看待世界的所有不同方式的色彩和美丽). Yeah, and **sort of the richness and the diversity and the dynamism of being human** (以及人类的丰富性、多样性和活力).

**Segment 17: Fighting Back - Media Literacy and Questioning**

So I **guess my next question is what do we do now** (我想我的下一个问题是我们现在该怎么办)? In your talk you say that we are **subconsciously now confusing the AI version of language with actual language** (我们现在潜意识地将AI版本的语言与真实语言混淆). And then that means as we've been talking about the **real thing is getting closer to the machine version of the thing** (真实的事物正变得越来越接近机器版本的事物). **What do we do about this** (我们该怎么办)? It **seems like we have a collective action problem** (这似乎是一个集体行动问题). You **can't avoid it** (你无法避免). You **simply cannot avoid it** (你根本无法避免). Now I **do think by being conscious about this** (我确实认为通过意识到这一点), the **more aware we are of what these platforms are doing to us** (我们越是意识到这些平台对我们做了什么), the **more resistance we have** (我们就会有更多的抵抗). This is a virus you are **able to form your own kind of antibodies through media literacy** (/ˈeɪbəl tu fɔːrm yʊər oʊn kaɪnd əv ˈæntaɪˌbɑːdiz θruː ˈmiːdiə ˈlɪtərəsi/, 能够通过媒体素养形成你自己的抗体). And it **goes so much beyond language** (它远远超出了语言). I think language is the **canary in the coal mine** (/kəˈnɛri ɪn ðə koʊl maɪn/, 煤矿里的金丝雀) that **sort of proxy for greater cultural shifts** (/sɔːrt əv ˈprɑksi fɔːr ˈɡreɪtər ˈkʌltʃərəl ʃɪfts/, 某种程度上是更大文化转变的代表) that we **can pay attention to** (可以关注的) because it **tells us what's going on in society in that telling truth kind of way** (它以揭示真相的方式告诉我们社会中正在发生什么). But I'm **worried about political shifts** (我担心政治转变). I'm **worried about social shifts** (我担心社会转变). Chatchy PT has **different political leanings in each language** (/ˈdɪfərənt pəˈlɪtɪkəl ˈliːnɪŋz ɪn iːtʃ ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/, 每种语言都有不同的政治倾向) because it **represents the values of those countries differently** (它以不同的方式代表这些国家的价值观). That's **really concerning to me that** (令我非常担忧的是) there's a **direction that we are being trained to think** (我们正被训练朝着某个方向思考). When you **interact with a platform like X** (当你与像X这样的平台互动时), you **got to know that Elon Musk is artificially amplifying his tweet** (你必须知道埃隆·马斯克正在人为地放大他的推文) so he can **go more viral** (更广泛传播). When you **interact with the chatbot, like GROC** (当你与像GROC这样的聊天机器人互动时), we also **know that Elon Musk changes what the chatbot says** (我们也知道埃隆·马斯克会修改聊天机器人的说法) so that we **align with his picture of reality** (/əˈlaɪn wɪð hɪz ˈpɪktʃər əv riˈæləti/, 与他所描绘的现实保持一致). We **need to know that so that we can maintain our reality** (我们需要知道这一点，以便维持我们的现实).

**Segment 18: Responsibility for Media Literacy**

**Who do you think is responsible for not only continuing to have these conversations but helping make sure that the next generation's coming up are media literate and hip to what's happening here** (你认为谁有责任不仅继续进行这些对话，还要确保下一代具备媒体素养并了解这里正在发生的事情)? Yeah. And I also **want to caveat** (/ˈkæviət/, 声明/警告). I **do not think the responsibility should merely be on the consumer of media** (我不认为责任仅仅在于媒体消费者). I'm **simply pushing that right now** (我只是现在在推广这个观点) because I **think that's the best thing we can do in this current culture moment** (我认为这是我们在当前文化时刻能做的最好的事情) where it **doesn't seem like we have any power against the platforms** (我们似乎对这些平台没有任何权力). The **moment when we can start regulating these platforms, seriously** (我们能认真开始监管这些平台的那一刻), we **should be doing that** (我们应该这样做). But **in the meantime** (与此同时), **in our personal lives** (在我们的个人生活中), the **way that I have been navigating social media is trying to build that radical media literacy for myself** (我处理社交媒体的方式是努力为自己建立那种激进的媒体素养). It's my **dream that one day in 10th grade ELA class, along with poetry, scantions, you have a unit for how to look at TikTok** (我梦想有一天，在十年级的英语语言艺术课上，除了诗歌和韵律分析，还会有一个单元教如何看待TikTok). And I **know that sounds ridiculous** (我知道那听起来很荒谬), but it's **not a joke** (这不是玩笑). **In the same way** (同样地), you **should think about the news** (你应该思考新闻). You **should think about the New York Times is not printing some stories** (你应该思考《纽约时报》没有刊登一些故事) because they're **filtered through layers of manufactured consent** (/ˈfɪltərd θruː ˈleɪərz əv ˌmænjʊˈfæktʃərd kənˈsɛnt/, 经过多层“被制造的同意”过滤). We **should teach our kids about engagement optimization algorithms** (我们应该教孩子关于互动优化算法的知识) and how these are **working to trigger your reptile brain impulses** (/ˈwɜːrkɪŋ tu ˈtrɪɡər yʊər ˈrɛptaɪl breɪn ˈɪmpʌlsɪz/, 正在触发你的爬行动物脑冲动) and they're **not actually aligned with what you want** (它们实际上与你想要的并不一致). So **all of these things, I think, should be taught** (我认为所有这些都应该被教导). This is actually **why I haven't joined the whole wait until a phone** (这实际上就是我没有加入“等等，直到有了手机”运动的原因). You **know how there's this big campaign to keep kids off of screens** (你知道有这样一个旨在让孩子远离屏幕的大型运动). I **actually worry that it's making them completely illiterate** (/ɪˈlɪtərɪt/, 文盲的) until they **just jump in and you know, rap jump into the deep end** (他们只是跳进去，然后你知道，直接跳入深渊). I **would say it's pretty bad to go from zero to 100 like that** (我会说像那样从零到一百是相当糟糕的). But it's **such a delicate question** (/sʌtʃ ə ˈdɛlɪkət ˈkwɛstʃən/, 这样一个微妙的问题). Like **clearly, it is bad for children to be looking at iPads at age two** (显然，两岁的孩子看iPad是不好的). I **would also really have to navigate that when I become a parent** (当我成为父母时，我也必须处理这个问题). Sure. Yeah. It's a **scary question to be grappling with** (/ˈskɛri ˈkwɛstʃən tu bi ˈɡræplɪŋ wɪð/, 一个令人担忧的问题). But I think like **slowly integrating while teaching them lessons about this thing that's being shown** (一边慢慢融入，一边教他们关于正在展示的事物的课程), oh, that's an AI generated video. Right. That is **not what things really look like** (那不是事物真实的样子). Or a **lesson that I would always want to teach my kid is like, why did this show up on your for you page** (我总是想教我的孩子一课，那就是：为什么这个视频会出现在你的“为你推荐”页面上)? When you **get a video, ask yourself that question** (当你收到一个视频时，问自己这个问题). Right. **Think about what videos are not showing up** (想想有哪些视频没有出现) because there's always a **survivor should buy us to what's filtered** (幸存者偏误效应). The **thing that's showing up is generating engagement** (正在显示的东西正在产生互动). It's **past content guidelines for the platform** (它符合平台的内容指南). It's **targeted to the platform's idea of who you are** (它针对平台对你身份的认知), which is an **incorrect idea in the same way that the word delves incorrectly represented** (就像“delves”这个词被错误地表达一样，这是一个不正确的想法). And then **along with that, strategies for how to remain present and mindful and literate** (与此同时，保持专注、留心和有素养的策略). So I think the **thing we least like about scrolling is that it makes us feel like we just wasted a bunch of time** (我们最不喜欢滚动浏览的原因是它让我们感觉浪费了很多时间). I've **personally sort of found ways to extract meaning and presence from being on social media** (我个人找到了一些从社交媒体中提取意义和存在感的方法). But it **takes like turning off cognitive frames that they're trying to trick you into** (但这需要关闭他们试图诱骗你的认知框架). And that's **part of it as well** (那也是其中一部分).

**Segment 19: Interview - Defining a Good Idea and Rituals**

Okay. Adam, Alex, we **could talk about all this stuff with you for so much longer** (我们可以和你聊很久). But this is an **excellent extrapolation and building upon your talk** (对你的演讲进行了极好的推断和扩展). Okay, **stick with us** (请继续关注). I'm **going to hit you with a few rapid fire general questions unrelated to your talk specifically** (我将向你提出一些与你演讲无关的快速一般性问题), but you can **tie it back if you want** (如果你想，可以联系起来). All right. **Let's go** (开始吧). What does a **good idea look like to you** (你认为一个好主意是什么样的)? Something that is **weird and different from what other people have done** (与众不同). And you have to **draw on something that exists already, I suppose, but remix it in a new way** (我想，你必须借鉴已有的东西，但以新的方式重新组合). Yeah. **Collisions of ideas that have been previously out there** (之前存在的思想碰撞), right? **Drawing the connection between the data points that doesn't exist yet** (在尚未存在的数据点之间建立联系). Yeah. Yeah. I like **kind of mixing and remixing for creativity** (我喜欢为了创造力而混合和再混合). All right. What is a **New Year's resolution or intention or a ritual of yours** (你的新年决心、意图或习惯是什么)? If you're interesting. Okay. **Ritual** (/ˈrɪtʃuəl/, 仪式/习惯). I **do have a ritual** (我确实有一个习惯). So it's **become a yearly tradition that my birthday is on January 3rd** (我的生日是1月3日，这已成为一个年度传统) and the **Moby Dick marathon and new Bedford Massachusetts is also on January 3rd** (马萨诸塞州新贝德福德的《白鲸记》马拉松朗读活动也在1月3日). So I'm **going with a bunch of friends to to read Moby Dick for 25 hours** (我要和一群朋友去读《白鲸记》25小时). What? Everybody just **gets together and sits and reads** (大家只是聚在一起坐着阅读)? It's terrible. It's wonderful. Yeah. It's a **really painful experience** (一次非常痛苦的经历), but I **think it's the only way you can read Moby Dick** (我认为这是唯一能读《白鲸记》的方式) and I you **kind of go mad along with Captain A** (你有点像A船长一样发疯). So you were **quietly reading in a crowd** (在人群中安静地阅读) or are you **reading a loud popcorn style** (大声地轮流朗读)? No. No. It's like there's there's **one person chosen to read** (一个人被选中阅读) and it **goes for 25 hours** (持续25小时). So I **have like a 130 AM reading slot** (我有一个凌晨1点30分的朗读时间). My friend John has a **530 AM reading slot** (凌晨5点30分的朗读时间). Yeah. This is the **second year we're definitely making this a yearly thing** (这是第二年我们肯定会把它变成年度活动). Do you **know your reading like which part of the book you're going to be at** (你知道你将朗读书的哪一部分) or **everybody's going to collectively be at at your 130 AM reading slot** (在你的凌晨1点30分的朗读时间，大家会共同阅读到哪里)? I'm **really hoping for the chapter stub kills a whale** (我真的很希望读到“Stub杀鲸鱼”那一章). Yes. That's **such a good one** (那真是个好章节). But yeah. So I don't know. **We'll see** (我们拭目以待). **We'll see** (我们拭目以待). Okay. That's **so funny** (太有趣了). All right. What is a **hobby or interest of yours unrelated to your work that you love so much that you might be able to give a Ted talk about it** (你有什么与工作无关的爱好或兴趣，你非常喜欢，甚至可以为此做TED演讲)? I **don't believe in hobbies** (我不相信爱好). I **think hobbies are strange** (我觉得爱好很奇怪). I think like **hobby is defined as this thing which is like slightly less serious than work but more serious than your other leisure activities** (爱好被定义为比工作稍微不那么严肃，但又比其他休闲活动更严肃的事情). And I **want to treat everything in my life with the equal importance of work and leisure** (我希望以工作和休闲同等重要的态度对待生活中的一切). I like sitting. I like eating. I like listening to music but that **sounds boring now** (现在听起来很无聊). Now I **sound boring** (我听起来很无聊). I **do have like activities I do for fun** (我确实有一些为了乐趣而做的活动) but I'm **anti calling things hobby** (我反对把事情称为爱好). I like that. All right. That **might be a hill you're willing to die on** (那可能是你愿意为之奋斗到底的观点) because my next question is what is an **ant hill you'd be willing to die on** (你愿意为之奋斗到底的观点是什么)? For example, I **would die on the hill that you know one locations pizza is better than another locations pizza** (我会坚持一个观点，那就是某个地方的披萨比另一个地方的披萨好吃). Do you **have anything that you feel like** (你有什么感觉)? Yeah. I **hate the word content** (我讨厌“内容”这个词) and I **know as a linguist and not supposed to hate words** (我知道作为语言学家不应该讨厌词语). This is **from my cultural critic perspective** (这是从我文化批评者的角度). I **think it's so strange that we talk about making content** (我觉得我们谈论制作“内容”很奇怪) because the word **implies something that is contained** (/ɪmˈplaɪz ˈsʌmθɪŋ ðæt ɪz kənˈteɪnd/, 暗示着被包含的东西) like the **contents of a box or drawer** (盒子或抽屉里的内容) and now **ask yourself like where is it being contained** (现在问自己，它被包含在哪里)? It's **being contained in the the medium of social media** (被包含在社交媒体的媒介中). So TikTok is like the box and then your content is this thing **held in the box** (放在盒子里的东西). And that **implies first of all that it's interchangeable with other pieces of content** (/ɪmˈplaɪz ˈfɜːrst əv ɔːl ðæt ɪts ˌɪntərˈtʃeɪndʒəbəl wɪð ˈʌðər ˈpiːsɪz əv ˈkɒntɛnt/, 首先意味着它可以与其他内容互换) and that you know the **content doesn't have anything special within it** (内容本身没有什么特别之处). Another **reframe potentially is that your video is the container and your idea or message is the content** (另一个潜在的重新定义是，你的视频是容器，你的想法或信息是内容). But we **don't talk about it on that level** (我们不从那个层面谈论它). We **distracted the level up and then it becomes this like commodifiable thing** (/dɪˈstræktɪd ðə ˈlɛvəl ʌp ænd ðɛn ɪt bɪˈkʌmz ðɪs laɪk kəˈmɑdɪfaɪəbəl θɪŋ/, 我们把层面提高，然后它就变成了一个可商品化的东西) where you can **talk about oh this is how you make better content this is how you make content every day** (你可以谈论“哦，这是你如何制作更好的内容，这是你如何每天制作内容”) and then you're like you **lose the plot of what you're trying to do** (你迷失了你正在努力做的事情的主旨) which is **spread good ideas** (传播好想法) and **spreading ideas critically also means your idea leaves the platform and content it's contained** (批判性地传播思想也意味着你的想法离开平台，内容被包含). So it's **very strange** (非常奇怪). I **try to avoid calling myself a content creator** (我尽量避免称自己为内容创作者) and **perhaps trying to reclaim the word influencer** (也许是试图重新定义“网红”这个词) because I **know that's like a little negatively coded** (/ˈnɛɡətɪvli ˈkoʊdɪd/, 有点负面含义) but that's **what I'm trying to do** (那就是我正在努力做的). I **want to influence people like it's like it'd be disingenuous to not say that** (我想要影响人们，就像不说出来就是不真诚一样). Okay. All right. Linguist influencer author etymologist but **certainly not merely a creator of content** (当然不仅仅是一个内容创作者). Adam Alexic **thank you so much for sitting down with us** (非常感谢你接受我们的采访). **Thank you** (谢谢).
