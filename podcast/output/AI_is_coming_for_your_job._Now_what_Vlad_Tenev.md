1. 演讲稿分段与重点词汇短语标注

Let's **take a moment** (花一点时间) and **reflect back upon** (/rɪˈflɛkt bæk əˈpɒn/, 回顾) our lives when we were 20 years old. Think about where you were and the opportunities for work and career that **lay in front of you** (呈现在你面前). I'm curious. Tell me how many of you had a **pretty good idea** (相当清楚的想法) of what you wanted to do for your career? Okay, not too many. How many were **overwhelmed** (/ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmd/, 不知所措) by all the options? Okay, I know I felt the same. Well, **buckle up** (/ˈbʌkl ʌp/, 系好安全带；做好准备). It's only going to get **more overwhelming** (更加令人不知所措).

When I was 20 years old, I was graduating from Stanford University with a degree in pure mathematics. Nobody had **sat me down to tell** (让我坐下来告诉) that my pure math major wasn't going to be the most **desirable** (/dɪˈzaɪərəbl/, 令人满意的；值得拥有的) **qualification** (/ˌkwɒlɪfɪˈkeɪʃn/, 资格) for **prospective employers** (/prəˈspɛktɪv ɪmˈplɔɪərz/, 潜在雇主). And I probably wouldn't have listened if they did. So I **went off along my default path** (沿着我的默认路径走了下去), a math PhD program at UCLA, **buying at least one more year to figure out** (争取至少一年时间来弄清楚) my career.

Now, my first month in graduate school, Lehman Brothers, **went under** (/wɛnt ˈʌndər/, 倒闭) the start of the **global financial crisis** (/ˈɡloʊbl faɪˈnænʃl ˈkraɪsɪs/, 全球金融危机). Most of my friends, particularly the ones that felt the most **secure** (/sɪˈkjʊər/, 稳固的；有保障的) in their financial careers, found themselves **packing up their cubicles** (收拾他们的格子间) **out of work** (失业). Some of us wondered whether the economy would **recover at all** (完全复苏) or whether we were **in store for** (即将面临) another **decade-long** (/ˈdɛkeɪd lɔŋ/, 持续十年的) great depression. But **amidst** (/əˈmɪdst/, 在…之中) the **uncertainty** (/ʌnˈsɜːrtnti/, 不确定性), the **pessimism** (/ˈpɛsɪmɪzəm/, 悲观主义), the **malaise** (/məˈleɪz/, 不适；萎靡不振), really, of that time, some of us found a **source of optimism** (/sɔːrs əv ˈɒptɪmɪzəm/, 乐观的源泉).

The iPhone, and in particular, the App Store, came out that very same year, 2008. I still remember when the SDK, which was the **instruction manual** (/ɪnˈstrʌkʃn ˈmænjuəl/, 使用说明书) for how to build iPhone apps, was released. I was at my parents' house, and I was **up all night reading it** (熬夜通宵阅读), learning, trying to understand. I saw an opportunity for a new **level playing field** (/ˈlɛvl ˈpleɪɪŋ fiːld/, 公平竞争环境). And if you think about it, **pretty much everything I've done since then** (从那时起我所做的一切), the company that I created, my professional career since that point, was a **product both of** (…的产物) the economic malaise, but the technological optimism of the time as well.

But times have changed. If the questions I'm hearing on the **podcast circuit** (/ˈpɒdkɑːst ˈsɜːrkɪt/, 播客圈) are **any indication** (/ˌɛni ɪndɪˈkeɪʃn/, 任何迹象), the average 20-year-old today also has **quite a bit of fear** (相当多的恐惧). But this time, **emerging technology** (/ɪˈmɜːrdʒɪŋ tɛkˈnɒlədʒi/, 新兴技术) is not the **antidote** (/ˈæntɪdoʊt/, 解药) to that fear. It's a source. And they're asking themselves, will that career I'm looking at **even be around** (甚至会存在) in 10 years? Will humans still be writing computer software? Will we even be writing books? And I think one reason why it **feels different this time** (这次感觉不同) is because AI, unlike the iPhone, is the first tool that we've built that's **capable of** (/ˈkeɪpəbl ɒv/, 能够) **leaving the toolbox** (走出工具箱), and we don't yet know its **limits** (/ˈlɪmɪts/, 限制).

A few years ago, I found another company with the **mission** (/ˈmɪʃn/, 使命) to build mathematical superintelligence. That's an artificial intelligence that can **reason** (/ˈriːzn/, 推理) and **solve problems** (解决问题) better than any mathematician. You know, when I grew up, I always thought of mathematics as the **pinnacle of** (/ˈpɪnəkl ɒv/, 巅峰) human **intellectual activity** (/ˌɪntəˈlɛktʃuəl ækˈtɪvəti/, 智力活动). If you could solve math problems, you could **do pretty much anything** (几乎做任何事情). So, a superhuman AI at mathematics could **potentially** (/pəˈtɛnʃəli/, 潜在地) be superhuman at everything. And that's a bit of a **scary thought** (可怕的想法).

So when you think about that, and I **combine that with** (将…与…结合) my day job, which is running a **global financial services platform** (/ˈɡloʊbl faɪˈnænʃl ˈsɜːrvɪsɪz ˈplætfɔːrm/, 全球金融服务平台), it's **led to me spending a lot of time pondering** (导致我花费大量时间思考) one very important question. What do we do in a world where the **vast majority of** (/vɑːst məˈdʒɒrəti ɒv/, 绝大多数的) today's jobs are gone? And I want to analyze this question **rationally** (/ˈræʃənəli/, 理性地) without fear and **hyperbole** (/haɪˈpɜːrbəli/, 夸张). One way to do it is to **look back through history** (回顾历史) and see if there's been a time where we **face this type of** (面临这种类型的) **job disruption** (/dɪsˈrʌpʃn/, 工作中断/颠覆) before at anything **near these levels** (接近这些水平), and how we as humans have **navigated it** (/ˈnævɪɡeɪtɪd ɪt/, 驾驭它；应对它).

I should say one thing. I'm a technologist, not a historian, so with that **caveat** (/ˈkævɪæt/, 告诫；前提条件), let's go back in time to a world a 20-year-old would have known very long ago, tens of thousands of years ago, to be **more precise** (/mɔːr prɪˈsaɪs/, 更精确地说). The main **occupations** (/ˌɒkjuˈpeɪʃnz/, 职业) of this time, the Paleolithic era, are **largely gone** (大体上消失了), hunters, gatherers, tool makers, but they didn't **disappear overnight** (一夜之间消失). Instead, they were **subdivided into** (/ˈsʌbdɪvaɪdɪd ˈɪntuː/, 细分为) lots of other more specialized jobs. So why don't we move forward to the Neolithic era? Now here, humans have **mastered** (/ˈmæstərd/, 掌握) a few new things, farming, **keeping livestock** (/ˈkiːpɪŋ ˈlaɪvstɒk/, 饲养牲畜), and this was a big **transformation** (/ˌtrænsfərˈmeɪʃn/, 转变). Actually, the invention of these things allowed us to **spend more time doing what we consider creative work** (花费更多时间从事我们认为的创造性工作), and **less time on pure survival and subsistence** (更少时间用于纯粹的生存和生计). This **opened up a lot of new jobs** (开辟了许多新工作). You had **artisans** (/ˈɑːrtɪznz/, 工匠) like weavers, farmers, potters, construction laborers, and these jobs too, largely all gone. So in the US today, farmers **make up** (/meɪk ʌp/, 构成) less than 2% of the **workforce** (/ˈwɜːrkfɔːrs/, 劳动力).

Let's move ahead through the changing jobs of the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, one of my favorites, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, and the Age of Exploration. Too many jobs to count, a lot of them are gone. Now, any blacksmiths or explorers in this room? I didn't think so. I would have loved to be an explorer. How cool of a job would that be? It might come back with space exploration. My great grandfather was a farmer in a village near Stara's, Agorable, Gariah. Now, **legend has it** (/ˈlɛdʒənd hæz ɪt/, 传说中), he was the first person in his village to see an automobile. When he saw it, he ran back into the village and said, there's a dragon out in the fields. His son, my grandfather, was also a farmer that didn't **venture too far from** (/ˈvɛntʃər tuː fɑːr frɒm/, 冒险走太远) the village. His son, my father, was the first in his family to go to the big city, Varna Bulgaria, on the Black Sea coast, where I was also born. There, he became a professor of tourism, which was certainly a job that my grandfather and great grandfather never **imagined** (/ɪˈmædʒɪnd/, 想象).

If you think about it, most of our **last names** (/lɑːst neɪmz/, 姓氏) are from jobs that our families no longer do. Potter, Butler, Butcher, even the most common, Smith. Any Fletcher in the audience? Anyone know what a Fletcher is? I was **going over my talk** (回顾我的演讲稿) this weekend and my son said, I know what a Fletcher is, dad. He plays Minecraft. **Everything old is new again** (旧事重提，或指事物循环). right? A Fletcher is someone that makes and sells arrows. So if you know someone with that last name, their relatives were arms dealers.

Now my point in all of this is you can probably **take any prediction that you see** (接受你看到的任何预测) in the media of job disruption. And **in the fullness of time** (/ɪn ðə ˈfʊlnəs ɒv taɪm/, 假以时日；最终), at some point, even that will be an **underestimate** (/ˌʌndərˈɛstɪmeɪt/, 低估). Even that will be **conservative** (/kənˈsɜːrvətɪv/, 保守的). And what we find is that job disruption is then an **essential quality** (/ɪˈsɛnʃl ˈkwɒləti/, 基本特征) of **human evolution** (/ˈhjuːmən ˌiːvəˈluːʃn/, 人类进化). We **want work to disappear** (希望工作消失) because it means that we're doing our jobs as humans, **making our lives better and easier** (让我们的生活更好更轻松). And when it comes to labor, we **yearn to** (/jɜːrn tuː/, 渴望) **increase dollars earned per hour worked** (提高每小时工作所得). And this creates the market for the **ever improving set of innovations** (/ˈɛvər ɪmˈpruːvɪŋ sɛt ɒv ˌɪnəˈveɪʃnz/, 不断改进的创新). that **save us time and money** (节省我们的时间和金钱).

So with AI, maybe it's not the job disruption itself that **makes us so nervous** (让我们如此紧张), but the **speed with which it's happening** (它发生的速度) and the **acceleration** (/əkˌsɛləˈreɪʃn/, 加速). Maybe that's what makes us nervous. So why don't we accelerate? We're going to go **right through** (直接穿过) the **industrial revolution** (/ɪnˈdʌstriəl ˌrɛvəˈluːʃn/, 工业革命) into the **modern era** (/ˈmɒdərn ˈɪərə/, 现代). So in the 20th century, a young person in the **wake of** (/weɪk ɒv/, 伴随…而来) companies expanding and automating, there was a lot of change, would have found an **entirely new menu of jobs** (全新的工作选择) that their parents **never had access to** (从未接触过). So instead of working in a factory, they would have had the **selection of a wide assortment of** (/sɪˈlɛkʃn ɒv ə waɪd əˈsɔːrtmənt ɒv/, 广泛的选择) new office jobs. And some of the parents were probably thinking, you **said in a chair all day** (整天坐在椅子上), that's not real work.

Now, let's go through the **internet era** (/ˈɪntərˌnɛt ˈɪərə/, 互联网时代). Okay, **most of us have lived through** (我们大多数人都经历过) at least a **portion of this** (/ˈpɔːrʃn ɒv ðɪs/, 一部分). and we see **all around us jobs that didn't exist before** (我们周围有很多以前不存在的工作). Some of us are probably in them, maybe most of us. I know I am. So where does all this **leave our 20 year old** (让我们的20岁年轻人处于什么境地) at the **dawn of** (/dɔːn ɒv/, …的黎明；开始) the AI era?

One **feature that we found is recurrent throughout generations** (我们发现一个贯穿几代人的共同特征) is this feeling of **exceptionalism** (/ɪkˈsɛpʃənəlɪzəm/, 特殊主义). We'd like to think that somehow we're at a **discontinuity** (/ˌdɪskɒntɪˈnjuːɪti/, 不连续性；中断), where history ends, and we're in a new world with **no precedent** (/noʊ ˈprɛsɪdənt/, 没有先例). And maybe it's true this time, we really don't know for building a **super assistant** (/ˈsuːpər əˈsɪstənt/, 超级助手) or an **apex predator** (/ˈeɪpɛks ˈprɛdətər/, 顶级掠食者). We don't. And certainly all change and disruption **brings with it a painful transition** (带来痛苦的过渡). Jobs will disappear, perhaps they'll disappear at an **accelerating rate** (/əkˌsɛləˈreɪtɪŋ reɪt/, 加速的速度). But at the same time, what we've **gone through here** (这里所经历的) is tens of thousands of years of human history. And we see one **undeniable trend** (/ˌʌndɪˈnaɪəbl trɛnd/, 不可否认的趋势). There's going to be new jobs and **lots and lots of them** (很多很多).

AI researchers **talk about this idea of a singularity** (/ˈsɪŋɡjʊˈlærəti/, 奇点), an **intelligence explosion** (/ɪnˈtɛlɪdʒəns ɪkˈsploʊʒn/, 智能爆炸). But what we see in the data is that we're also on a **curve of rapidly accelerating job creation** (快速加速创造就业的曲线), which I like to call the **job singularity** (就业奇点), a **Cambrian explosion of** (/ˈkæmbriən ɪkˈsploʊʒn ɒv/, 寒武纪大爆发，意指大规模出现) not just new jobs, but new **job families** (/dʒɒb ˈfæmɪliz/, 职业类别) across **every imaginable field** (/ˈɛvri ɪˈmædʒɪnəbl fiːld/, 每一个可以想象的领域). Where the internet gave people **worldwide reach** (/ˈwɜːrldwaɪd riːtʃ/, 全球影响力), AI gives them a **world-class staff** (/wɜːrld ˈklɑːs stɑːf/, 世界一流的员工). And so if you look at this **cloud of jobs** (/klaʊd ɒv dʒɒbz/, 大量的职位), certainly there's going to be some jobs that we **can't predict yet** (尚无法预测). But I think we can make some predictions. There's going to be a **flurry of** (/ˈflʌri ɒv/, 一阵；大量) new **entrepreneurial activity** (/ˌɒntrəprəˈnɜːriəl ækˈtɪvəti/, 创业活动) with **micro corporations** (/ˈmaɪkroʊ ˌkɔːrpəˈreɪʃnz/, 微型公司), **solo institutions** (/ˈsoʊloʊ ˌɪnstɪˈtuːʃnz/, 个人机构), and **single-person unicorns** (/ˈsɪŋɡl ˈpɜːrsn ˈjuːnɪkɔːrnz/, 一人独角兽公司), which **by the way** (/baɪ ðə weɪ/, 顺便说一下), I don't think we're **very far from** (离…不远).

Another **defining feature of** (/dɪˈfaɪnɪŋ ˈfiːtʃər ɒv/, …的决定性特征) this job singularity is that when you look into the future, the jobs will not **look like real work** (看起来像真正的工作). **Much like to our predecessors** (/mʌtʃ laɪk tuː ˈaʊər ˈprɛdɪˌsɛsərz/, 就像我们的前辈一样), our current jobs would have **looked like leisure** (/lʊkt laɪk ˈliːʒər/, 看起来像休闲活动). We have people **getting paid to play video games** (玩电子游戏还能赚钱), **eat at restaurants** (在餐馆吃饭), travel, and **talk to their friends on video** (和朋友视频聊天). Those last people we call podcast bros. And we **take our jobs very seriously** (非常认真对待我们的工作). Those of us that **do well** (做得好) certainly wouldn't say it's easy. But if you **took someone from the 20th century** (假设你带一个20世纪的人来) when people first started **contemplating these problems** (/ˈkɒntəmpleɪtɪŋ ðiːz ˈprɒbləmz/, 思考这些问题), and they could **peek into our world today** (/piːk ˈɪntuː ˈaʊər wɜːrld təˈdeɪ/, 窥探我们今天的世界), they would think that all of the predictions around **technological unemployment** (/ˌtɛknəˈlɒdʒɪkl ˌʌnɪmˈplɔɪmənt/, 技术性失业) **came true** (实现了). They'd say we don't have any more jobs. And I bet that we would **feel the same about our descendants** (/dɪˈsɛndənts/, 后代) in the future.

So now what? We've shown that there's going to be lots of jobs to **choose from** (可供选择). Some would argue **too many** (太多了), and that the jobs **along with** (连同) the flurry of new entrepreneurial activity will likely **look like leisure** (看起来像休闲活动) to us. **Much like our jobs did to our ancestors** (/ˈænsɛstərz/, 祖先). And I can tell you with **near certainty** (/nɪər ˈsɜːrtnti/, 几乎可以肯定) that a **humanity that's capable of building** (有能力建造的） a super intelligent AI also has the **creativity** (/ˌkriːeɪˈtɪvəti/, 创造力) to **navigate through** (/ˈnævɪɡeɪt θruː/, 驾驭；应对) this **potential** (/pəˈtɛnʃl/, 潜在的) **job doom and gloom scenario** (/dʒɒb duːm ænd ɡluːm sɪˈnɑːrioʊ/, 工作末日悲观情景). Although we'll **never stop worrying about it** (永远不会停止担心). We'll never stop worrying about it. Because **being hyper vigilant about** (/ˈhaɪpər ˈvɪdʒɪlənt əˈbaʊt/, 对…高度警惕) **threats to our survival** (/θrɛts tuː ˈaʊər sərˈvaɪvl/, 生存威胁) is a **key part of our survival mechanism** (/ˈkiː pɑːrt ɒv ˈaʊər sərˈvaɪvl ˈmɛkənɪzəm/, 我们生存机制的关键部分). Also a **key part of evolution** (进化的关键部分). What **makes us human** (使我们成为人类的特质). And although it'll **take a lot of time to go into** (需要很多时间深入探讨) what kind of jobs are **future proved** (/ˈfjuːtʃər pruːvd/, 经得起未来考验的), I can tell you that you **shouldn't take predictions about future job disruption to keep you from doing something you feel very passionately about** (不应该让未来工作颠覆的预测阻止你做你非常热爱的事情).

You know when I was a kid in the 90s, teachers **discouraged me from** (/dɪsˈkɜːrɪdʒd miː frɒm/, 劝阻我不要做) becoming a computer programmer. I don't know if many else heard this. But back then it was a **common thought** (/ˈkɒmən θɔːt/, 普遍的看法) that all those jobs would be **shipped off to China** (/ʃɪpt ɒf tuː ˈtʃaɪnə/, 转移到中国). Around the same time, if you guys remember, 1997, deep blue beat Gary Kasparov in chess. That was the first time an AI **succeeded in** (/səkˈsiːdɪd ɪn/, 成功做某事) what was considered a **solely human intellectual affair** (/ˈsoʊlli ˈhjuːmən ˌɪntəˈlɛktʃuəl əˈfɛər/, 纯粹人类智力活动). But now the chess industry is **booming** (/ˈbuːmɪŋ/, 蓬勃发展) bigger than ever. So even where it **seems obvious** (/siːmz ˈɒbviəs/, 显而易见), sometimes our **predictions of the future** (/prɪˈdɪkʃnz ɒv ðə ˈfjuːtʃər/, 对未来的预测) **end up being completely off** (/ɛnd ʌp ˈbiːɪŋ kəmˈpliːtli ɒf/, 结果完全错误).

**Humanity has always excelled at providing itself with meaning and purpose** (/hjuːˈmænɪti hæz ˈɔːlweɪz ɪkˈsɛld æt prəˈvaɪdɪŋ ɪtˈsɛlf wɪð ˈmiːnɪŋ ænd ˈpɜːrpəs/, 人类总是擅长为自己提供意义和目的), even in the **darkest and most uncertain of times** (/ˈdɑːrkɪst ænd moʊst ʌnˈsɜːrtn ɒv taɪmz/, 最黑暗和最不确定的时期). So if I had to guess, I feel very, very **confident that** (/ˈkɒnfɪdənt ðæt/, 确信) the 20 year olds of the future, perhaps **in collaboration with** (/ɪn kəˌlæbəˈreɪʃn wɪð/, 与…合作), AI, will continue to **build new things** (创造新事物) which **simultaneously** (/ˌsaɪmlˈteɪniəsli/, 同时地) we're going to be **scared of** (害怕) but also **excited by** (感到兴奋). Thank you for considering these ideas.
